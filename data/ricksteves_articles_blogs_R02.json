A system of locks near the central train station controls the flow outward to (eventually) the North Sea, and the flow inward of the tides. The locks are opened periodically to flush out polluted water. Some of the boats in the canals look pretty funky by day, but Amsterdam is an unpretentious, anti-status city.

And shops without the outdoor option are in for an extra challenge, as many local smokers would rather get their pot \u201cto go\u201d than smoke it without tobacco at their neighborhood coffeeshop.", "Pre-rolled joints are now sold pure, with the non-tobacco \u201chamburger helper\u201d herb mix, and with tobacco. The pure marijuana joints are much easier to buy now than just a year ago. Some shops sell individual joints (\u20ac2-5, or about $3-7.50). Others sell only small packs of three or four joints. Shops sell marijuana and hash in pre-rolled joints and in little baggies. Shops have loaner bongs and \u201csmoke-free\u201d inhalers, and dispense cigarette-rolling papers like toothpicks.", "While Dutch law allows for shops to keep an inventory of up to 500 grams, the wholesale dimension is the famous \u201cgrey area\u201d in the law. It\u2019s just left out of the equation. Most shops get their inventory from the pot equivalent of home brewers or microbrewers. Shops with better \u201cboutique suppliers\u201d get the reputation for having better-quality weed (and regularly winning the annual Cannabis Cup). The tax authorities don\u2019t want to see more than 500 grams (about a pound) on the books at the end of each accounting cycle, and shops lose their license when found with too much in stock.", "A shop could retail a ton of pot with no problem, as long as it maintains that tiny stock and refills it as needed. Amsterdam\u2019s mayor, understanding that this just has the city busy with small-time deliveries, has proposed doubling the allowable inventory level. The reason the inventory level is kept so small: They want shops to stay small and not become bases for exportation. Providing pot to neighboring countries would bring more international pressure on the Netherlands to crack down on its coffeeshop culture.", "The other legal trend is that licenses are not being renewed in some neighborhoods as the city wants to maintain a certain smattering of shops and not have too big a concentration in any one area.", "The Dutch are not necessarily pro-marijuana, but they do believe that a prohibition on marijuana would cause more problems than it solves. Statistics support the Dutch belief that their system works. They have fewer hard drug problems than other countries. And they believe America\u2019s policy is based on fear, misinformation, and electoral politics, rather than rationality. And, after a 10-year track record, the Dutch have found that their drug policy does not result in more pot smoking. Statistically, Americans smoke twice as much pot as the Dutch (per capita).", "You are reading \"Lessons Learned in an Amsterdam Coffeeshop\", an entry posted on 16 August 2008 by Rick Steves.", "47 replies to this entry.

Amsterdam\u2019s leaders recognize that legalized marijuana and the Red Light District\u2019s prostitution are part of the edgy charm of the city; the mayor wants to keep both, but get rid of the accompanying sleaze. The Dutch have learned that when sex and soft drugs are sold on the street (rather than legally), you get pimps, gangs, disease, hard drugs, and violence. Amsterdam recognizes the pragmatic wisdom of its progressive policies and is bucking the federal shift to the right.

But the independent-minded Dutch (especially young people) don\u2019t want to be registered as pot users, so they are buying it on the street \u2014 which is rekindling the black market, and will likely translate to more violence, turf wars, and hard drugs being sold. The next step: In January of 2013, this same law will come into effect nationwide \u2014 including in Amsterdam, whose many coffeeshops will no longer be allowed to legally sell marijuana to tourists.", "Locals point out that the Dutch are not more \u201cpro-drugs\u201d than other nations. For example, my Dutch friends note that, while the last 20 years of US Presidents (Clinton, Bush, Obama) have admitted or implied that they\u2019ve smoked marijuana, no Dutch prime minister ever has. Many Dutch people are actually very anti-drugs. The Dutch word for addiction is \u201censlavement.\u201d But the Dutch response to the problem of addiction is very different from that of the US.", "Being a port city, Amsterdam has had its difficult times with drug problems. In the 1970s, thousands of hard-drug addicts made Amsterdam\u2019s old sailor quarter, Zeedijk, a no-go zone. It was nicknamed \u201cHeroin Alley.\u201d To fight it, they set up coffeeshop laws (allowing for the consumption of pot while cracking down on hard-drug use). Today Zeedijk is gentrified, there\u2019s no sense of the old days, and various studies indicate that Holland has fewer hard-drug users, per capita, than many other parts of Europe.", "From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, the number of coffeeshops exploded. The Dutch observed that marijuana use rates increased, too, so they made changes, closing shops that ignored rules or generated neighborhood complaints. Now, new coffeeshop licenses are no longer being issued, and the number of coffeeshops in Amsterdam has declined from a peak of over 700 to about 200 today. With the movement afoot to crack down on things, coffeeshops are trying harder than ever to be good citizens and to nurture good relations with their neighbors.", "While most Americans like their joints made purely of marijuana, the Dutch (like most Europeans) are accustomed to mixing tobacco with marijuana. There are several reasons: Back in the 1970s, most \u201cpot smokers\u201d here smoked hash, which needs to be mixed with something else (like tobacco) to light up. Today, more Dutch prefer \u201cherbal cannabis\u201d \u2014 the marijuana bud common in the US \u2014 but they still keep the familiar tobacco in their joints. Tobacco-mixed joints also go back to hippie days, when pot was expensive and it was simply wasteful to pass around a pure marijuana joint. Mixing in tobacco allowed poor hippies to be generous without going broke. And, finally, the Dutch don\u2019t dry and cure their marijuana, so it\u2019s simply hard to smoke without tobacco. Any place that caters to Americans will have joints without tobacco, but you have to ask specifically for a \u201cpure\u201d joint. Joints are generally sold individually (for \u20ac3 to \u20ac5, depending on the strain you choose).", "Coffeeshops are allowed only half a kilo (about a pound) of pot in their inventory at any given time. On a typical day, a busy shop will sell three kilos (and, therefore, take six deliveries). Very little marijuana is imported anymore, as the technology is such that strains from all over the world can be grown in local greenhouses.

In the days of Henry Hudson, hemp was critical for quality rope and for sails. The word \u201ccanvas\u201d comes from the same root as \u201ccannabis.\u201d In fact, there was a time when tobacco was the pricey leaf, and sailors mixed hemp into their cigarettes to stretch their tobacco.", "Tourists who haven\u2019t smoked since they were students are famous for overdosing in Amsterdam, where they can suddenly light up without any paranoia. Coffeeshop baristas nickname tourists about to pass out \u201cWhitey\u201d \u2014 because of the color their face turns just before they hit the floor. The key is to eat or drink something sweet to stop from getting sick. Coca-Cola is a good fast fix, and coffeeshops keep sugar tablets handy.", "No one would say smoking pot is healthy. It\u2019s a drug. It\u2019s dangerous, and it can be abused. The Dutch are simply a fascinating example of how a society can allow marijuana\u2019s responsible adult use as a civil liberty, and treat its abuse as a health-care and education challenge rather than a criminal issue. They have a 25-year track record of not arresting pot smokers, and have learned that if you want to control a substance, the worst way to do it is to keep it illegal. Regulations are strictly enforced. While the sale of marijuana is allowed, advertising is not. You\u2019ll never see any promotions or advertising in windows. In fact, in many places, the prospective customer has to take the initiative and push a button to illuminate the menu in order to know what\u2019s for sale. And, surprisingly, marijuana is just not a big deal in the Netherlands \u2014 except to tourists coming from lands where you can do hard time for lighting up.

Winding up the hill you\u2019ll find yourself in an ensemble of grand temples. Led by the visionary architect/sculptor Pheidias, the Athenians built this complex of supersized, ornate temples worthy of the city\u2019s protector, Athena. Unlike most ancient sites, which have layers of ruins from different periods, the Acropolis was started and finished within two generations \u2014 a snapshot of the Golden Age set in stone. Pheidias\u2019 crowning achievement was the Parthenon: Simple, balanced, and orderly, this is the finest temple from the ancient world.", "\r\n\tAt the base of the hill stands the Acropolis Museum, which houses artifacts from the Acropolis. The striking, glassy building gives a postmodern jolt to the otherwise staid, concrete cityscape. The centerpiece is a life-size mock-up of the 525-foot marble frieze that once wrapped around the Parthenon. Of the original, the museum owns just 32 feet. The best parts are in London\u2019s British Museum. In the early 1800s, the Ottoman Turks, who controlled Greece and couldn\u2019t care less about its cultural treasures, were happy to take a bribe from Englishman Lord Elgin to let him make off with the finest ancient Greek statuary.", "\r\n\tWhile the Acropolis was Athens\u2019 ceremonial showpiece, at its foot sprawled the city\u2019s marketplace of Agora. This was where the real business of the day \u2014 commercial, political, social, and religious \u2014 took place.

As Romans didn\u2019t have democracy, their leaders had a taste for grandeur. So when the Romans came, they put an \u201cun-Greek\u201d veneer of power on the Agora, including pompous staircases, fancy pavement, oversized temples, and larger-than-life statues. Roman statues are always propped on something, with \u201ctoo much robe\u201d and interchangeable heads. Masters of both imperial ego and efficiency, they reused stone bodies, economically replacing the head with each new emperor. That\u2019s why lots of Roman statues are headless.", "\r\n\tAfter a day communing with Athens\u2019 ancients, I enjoy communing with locals at a traditional Greek restaurant. My favorite way to eat here is to order a medley of mezedes (small plates) to share. The selection, while predictable and routine, never gets old for me: tzatziki dip, garlic dip, fava bean dip, or a mix of all three on a serving platter; fried eggplant or zucchini; Greek salad; and big grilled peppers stuffed with feta cheese.", "\r\n\tUsually there\u2019s something from the sea, such as grilled calamari, sardines, or a plate of fried small fish (three inch), very small fish (two inch), or very, very small fish (one inch).

With the smaller fish, I leave nothing but a line of greasy fingerprints on the fringe of my paper tablecloth.", "\r\n\tWith dinner, I order the infamous resin-flavored retsina wine, which makes me want to sling a patch over one eye and say, \u201cArghh.\u201d The first glass is like drinking wood. The third glass is dangerous: It starts to taste good. If you drink any more, you\u2019ll smell like it the next day.", "\r\n\tWith a belly full of mezedes and just enough retsina, I walk off dinner on the pedestrian street that runs along the base of the Acropolis. Wandering this modern walkway under the floodlit Parthenon, I enjoy a mix of ancient splendor, the charming 19th-century \u201cold town,\u201d and a steady parade of modern Athenians doing the same thing.\u00a0", "\r\n\tA century and a half ago, Athens was a humble, forgotten city of about 8,000 people. Today one out of every three Greeks packs into this city of about four million.", "\r\n\tThe city has been infamous for its sprawl, noise, and pollution. My advice has long been to see the big sights, then get out. But visiting it recently to research my guidebook, I saw a dramatic change. The city has made a concerted effort to clean up and pedestrianize the streets, spiff up the museums, build a new airport, and invest in one of Europe's better public-transit systems.", "\r\n\tAthens has a long history. You'll walk in the footsteps of the great minds who created democracy, philosophy, theater, and more...even when you're dodging motorcycles on \"pedestrianized\" streets. Romantics can't help but get goose bumps as they kick around the same pebbles that once stuck in Socrates' sandals, with the floodlit Parthenon forever floating ethereally overhead. It rises gleaming like a beacon above the gray concrete drudgery of modern Athens. This is where the Greeks built the mighty Parthenon \u2014 the most famous temple on the planet, and an enduring symbol of ancient Athens' glorious Golden Age nearly 2,500 years ago.", "\r\n\tAlong with the stunning Acropolis, there's the Ancient Agora just below, and the remarkable National Archaeological Museum.

While the Persians, Ottomans, and British were cruel to the site in the past, the greatest dangers it faces now are acid rain and pollution. Ongoing restoration means that you might see some scaffolding \u2014 but even that can't take away from its greatness. I like to come late in the day, as the sun goes down, when the white Parthenon stone gleams a creamy golden brown.", "\r\n\tWhile the Acropolis was the city's ceremonial showpiece, it was the Ancient Agora that was the real heart of classical Athens. For some 800 years, it was the hub of all commercial, political, and social life, as well as home to much of the city's religious rites. Little survives from the classical period. Other than one very well-preserved temple and a rebuilt portico, it's a field of humble ruins nestled in the shadow of the Acropolis. But that makes it a quiet, uncrowded spot to wander and get a feel for the ancients.", "\r\n\tNorth of the city center is the world's best collection of ancient Greek art, the National Archaeological Museum. It takes you from 7000 B.C. to A.D. 500, from prehistoric and Mycenaean artifacts to the evolution of classical Greek statuary.", "\r\n\tThis museum now has a worthy competitor \u2014 the Acropolis Museum, built in a neighborhood just below the Parthenon. It fills an aching void, preserving and displaying cultural treasures once held prisoner in a musty old Acropolis-top museum next to the Parthenon.", "\r\n\tThe striking, glassy building \u2014 designed by Swiss-born, New York-based architect Bernard Tschumi \u2014 gives a postmodern jolt to Athens' otherwise staid, mid-century-concrete cityscape, even as it echoes the ancient history all around it. The building is the boldest symbol yet of the post-Olympics vision for Athens.", "\r\n\tThis is a world-class space, custom-built to showcase the Parthenon sculptures, along with truckloads of other artifacts, all complemented by modern exhibits. Its two lower levels are aligned with the foundations of the ancient ruins beneath the building (which are exposed and open to the public). The top floor sits askew, imitating the orientation of the Parthenon. Inside, the museum is designed to maximize natural light for illuminating the space and exhibits.", "\r\n\tThe new museum also serves as a sort of 21st-century Trojan horse, intended to lure the famous Elgin Marbles (the Parthenon sculptures) away from London's British Museum. In the early 19th century, the British ambassador to the Ottomans, Lord Elgin, got permission to strip marble panels from the Parthenon and take them to England.", "\r\n\tFor years, the Greeks have asked for the marbles back, and for years, the Brits have responded with claims that Greece can't give them a suitable home. And yet, now that this state-of-the-art facility is ready and waiting, it still seems unlikely that the marbles will be returned anytime soon. Britain is reluctant to give in, for fear of setting a precedent...and getting \"me, too\" notices from Italy, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, and all the other nations who'd like the missing pieces of their cultural heritage back. But even without the Marbles, this new museum captures the timeless splendor of ancient and modern Athens.", "It\u2019s great traveling in Greece during the shoulder season \u2014 the days are lovely and warm (not hot) and the crowds are few. I\u2019m here in historic, bustling Athens, home of the world\u2019s top ancient site: the Acropolis.

It was in Barcelona, in the 1890s, that Picasso grabbed hold of the artistic vision that rocketed him to Paris and fame.

Seeing Picasso's youthful, realistic art, you can better appreciate the genius of his later, more abstract art.", "\r\n\tFor a refreshing break from the dense old city, head north to the modern Eixample neighborhood, with its wide sidewalks, graceful shade trees, chic shops, and Art Nouveau frills. Barcelona was busting out of its medieval walls by the 1850s, and so a new town \u2014 called the Eixample, or Expansion \u2014 was laid out in a grid pattern. The original vision was an egalitarian one: Each 20-block-square district was to have its own hospital and large park, markets, schools, and daycare centers.", "\r\n\tBut over time the Eixample became a showcase for wealthy residents and their Catalan architects, who turned the flourishing Art Nouveau style into Modernisme, their own brand of decorative design. Buildings bloom with characteristic colorful, leafy, and flowing shapes in doorways, entrances, facades, and ceilings.", "\r\n\tBarcelona's most famous Modernista artist, Antoni Gaud\u00ed, created architectural fantasies that are a quirky quilt of galloping gables and organic curves. A quintessential example of Modernisme, La Pedrera (a.k.a. Casa Mil\u00e0) has walls of wavy stone and a fanciful, undulating rooftop, where 30 chimneys play volleyball with the clouds. At Casa Batll\u00f3, a green-blue ceramic-speckled facade, tibia-esque pillars, and shell-like balconies are inspired by nature, while the humpback roofline suggests a cresting dragon's back.", "\r\n\tBut Gaud\u00ed's best-known and most persistent work is the eternally unfinished Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, with its melting-ice-cream-cone spires and towers. The Nativity Facade, the only part of the church essentially completed in Gaud\u00ed's lifetime, shows the architect's original vision. Mixing Christian symbolism, images from nature, and the organic flair of Modernisme, it's an impressive example of his unmistakable style.", "\r\n\tClimb up between the spires for a gargoyle's-eye perspective of a living, growing, bigger-than-life building. Local craftsmen often finish up their careers by putting in a couple of years working on the project. The church is supposed to be completed in 2026, which marks the 100th anniversary of Gaud\u00ed's death. It could happen \u2014 after three decades of visits, I've seen considerable progress. Your admission helps pay for the ongoing construction.", "\r\n\tGaud\u00ed fans also enjoy the artist's magic in the colorful, freewheeling Park G\u00fcell, a 30-acre hilltop garden once intended to be a 60-residence housing project, a kind of gated community. Carpeted with fanciful mosaics and dotted with sculptures (including a giant tiled lizard), this park is a great place to cap the day.", "\r\n\tFrom art to food to markets, Barcelona specializes in lively \u2014 and that's why it's such a hit with travelers.", "\r\n\tIt's hard to top Barcelona, Spain's most cosmopolitan and fun city.

Every year, ten million visitors swoop into town, rambling the Ramblas, touring hidden corners of the Old City, and marveling at playful Modernista architecture.", "\r\n\tIf you want a break from the crowds, several day trips from Barcelona are tempting scene-changers: the mountaintop monastery of Montserrat, the Salvador Dali museum at Figueres, and the beach town of Sitges.", "\r\n\tFor almost a thousand years, Benedictine monks have lived atop Montserrat \u2014 the \"serrated mountain\" \u2014 which dramatically rockets up from the valley floor northwest of Barcelona. Poets claim that the mountain was carved by little angels with golden saws. Geologists blame nature at work. Either way, with its unique rock formations and dramatic cliff-clinging monastery, this is an inviting excursion for pilgrims with (or without) hiking boots. A one-hour train ride from Barcelona links up with a rack railway or a cable car to get you to the lofty site. Serious pilgrims walk up.", "\r\n\tLegend has it that in medieval times, shepherd children saw lights and heard songs coming from the mountain. They traced the activity to a cave, where they found a statue dubbed \"La Moreneta\" \u2014 \"the Black Madonna.\" The monastery quickly became a pilgrim magnet. The small wooden Mary is behind protective glass in the Montserrat basilica, but the royal orb she cradles in her hand is exposed, ready to receive the venerating touch of the faithful. Newlyweds in particular seek this Mary's blessing.", "\r\n\tFor hikers and nature lovers, a funicular climbs nearly a thousand feet above the monastery. Up top, the air is fresh and the views are spectacular, sweeping (on the clearest days) from the Mediterranean to the Pyrenees. From the trailhead here, well-signposted hikes radiate out. The most popular one is mostly downhill back to the monastery. Hiking along the peaceful trail makes me want to turn cartwheels.", "\r\n\tIf you're a Dal\u00ed devotee, head to Figueres (two hours north of Barcelona) and the strange, fanciful Dal\u00ed Theater-Museum. From the Figueres train station, it's an easy 15-minute walk to the museum. You can't miss it: It's painted pink, studded with golden loaves of bread, and topped with monumental eggs and a geodesic dome. For fans of Surrealism and Dal\u00ed, it's one of Europe's most enjoyable museums.", "\r\n\tMuch of the art in the building (a former theater) is movable and coin-operated, so have a few euro coins in your pockets when you go. You know how you can never get a cab when it's raining? Pop a coin into Dal\u00ed's personal 1941 Cadillac, and it rains inside the car.", "\r\n\tAnother highlight is the Mae West room. From just the right spot, you'll see that the sofa lips, fireplace nostrils, painting eyes, and drapery hair come together to make the face of the sultry actress. Wandering around this place, I can't help wondering: am I crazy, or is it Dal\u00ed? The artist himself is entombed in a crypt below center stage.", "\r\n\tIf you simply want to kick back without an agenda, go to welcoming Sitges, which has frequent 30-minute train service from Barcelona. With a much slower pulse than Barcelona, this resort town southwest of the city is a perfect break from sightseeing. Sitges has jet-set status, but it's hung on to its Old World charm while managing to be both family- and gay-friendly.", "\r\n\tThere are Modernista-style mansions here and a few worthy little museums, but I recommend just poking around the old town's whitewashed streets, crammed with caf\u00e9s and boutiques. Then head for the water to soak up the sun, sea, and sand.", "\r\n\tNine beaches, separated by breakwaters, extend southward from town (the last three are intimate and cove-like). Stroll down the seaside promenade or rent a beach chair for some extreme relaxing. Along the way, you have your choice of restaurants and chiringuitos (beachfront bars) for tapas, paella, and drinks.", "\r\n\tIf you happen to visit during one of Sitges' two big festivals (St. Bartholomew in late August and St. Tecla in late September), you may see teams of castellers competing to build human pyramids up to 60 feet high. Balancing on the shoulders of the people below, the castellers are judged by how quickly they can assemble and take down their people towers. No one is really sure how this quirky tradition got its start, but it's a perfect reflection of the region's team-building bent.", "\r\n\tSkipping out of Barcelona for the day is easy. Whether you experience the sacred, the surreal, or the seaside, you'll return to the city recharged and ready for whatever it has in store.", "For more than a century, strolling down Barcelona\u2019s main boulevard, the Ramblas, has been the thing to do when visiting. Sadly, the charm of the Ramblas has not survived the rise of mass tourism in Barcelona. Back when locals enjoyed strolling here, there was plenty of business to keep characteristic flower stalls, bird markets, and newspaper stands healthy. It\u2019s what gave the Ramblas its unique cultural charm. But today, the local clientele that kept these characteristic stalls in business is gone, replaced by tides of tourists.

The leveled neighborhood then provided a cleared-out no-man\u2019s-land outside the fort, which later became a place of execution. Later, in more peaceful times, the space was made into a market.

When these buildings were restored, great pains were taken to achieve authenticity, each one matching the color most likely used when it was originally built. The impressive Old Town Hall, with its bold yellow tower, stands at the top of the square. Near the bottom of the tower, a cannonball embedded in the facade acts as a reminder of Napoleon\u2019s impact on Bratislava.

This is a statue of Sch\u00f6ner N\u00e1ci, a poor carpet cleaner who, dressed in a black suit and top hat, brightened the streets of Bratislava during the communist days, offering gifts to the women he fancied.

This development includes a riverside park, luxury condos, a modern shopping mall, and an office park.", "\r\n\tDespite massive progress, holdovers from the city\u2019s communist past remain. The most prominent landmark from this time is the bizarre, flying-saucer-capped New Bridge.

He\u2019s a fine example of the youthful energy and leadership responsible for the success story of Slovakia.", "Martin explained to me why people who were between 15 and 25 in 1989 are most successful today, and the leaders of Slovakia. Throughout the communist period and in post-communist Czechoslovakia, there was no real political diplomatic class among Slovaks (because Czechs dominated Czechoslovak government). But when Slovakia peacefully split off from the Czech Republic in 1993\u2019s \u201cVelvet Divorce,\u201d many young Slovaks returned from the West and quickly took the helm, filling that void. Today Slovakia\u2019s wealthy class is about 40 years old, largely free from the old boys\u2019 network (most of whom stayed in the Czech lands). This trend played out in recent election, where for the first time, no former communist was sent to government (unique in Eastern Europe). The new \u201cDream Team,\u201d as many locals call the people in power now now, is liberal on social issues but realistic \u2014 decidedly not populist \u2014 on economic issues, as if inspired by the Greek fiasco (in fact, Slovakia has opted not to give bailout money to Greece).", "Spending a day with Martin to update our Bratislava chapter, I was able to fine-tune our existing coverage.

Bratislava hosted 19 coronations between 1563 to 1830. In fact, the last Hungarian coronation was not in Budapest, but in Bratislava.", "In 1760s, the Ottoman threat was gone, and the strategic military importance of Bratislava was over. Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa needed a comfy palace. She wanted her daughter Christina to stay close, so she made her son-in-law Albert the Viceroy of Hungary so that they\u2019d set up here. That\u2019s why Bratislava has a fine Habsburg palace and a strong Vienna connection.", "A third of the Slovak population emigrated to the US between 1880 and 1914. There were lots of deserters during World War I \u2014 opting to fight against rather than with Hungary. Even today, Hungarians lament loss of their old capital, Bratislava, from the post-World War I Treaty of Trianon. Meanwhile, you could say that historic Hungarian cultural oppression of the Czechs and Slovaks led to the creation of modern Czechoslovakia, as those smaller groups sought safety in numbers after World War I.", "The United States has long been a big supporter of Czechoslovakia. Between the world wars, Czechoslovakia was the only democracy and had the best economy in this part of Europe.", "Because of its location nearly on the border with Austria (and the West), Bratislava has many bomb shelters, built during the tense times around the Cuban Missile Crisis. Today these make ideal venues for clubs \u2014 right in the town, but powerfully soundproof.", "Why is it hard to think of any great Slovaks? During the time of Czechoslovakia (1919-1993), every time a Slovak excelled in culture or politics or sports, they were considered \u201cCzech\u201d by the rest of the world. (For example, the leader of the 1968 Prague Spring uprising against the Soviets, Alexander Dubcek, was actually Slovak.) As of 1993, suddenly Slovaks could celebrate their own heroes without the confusion.", "Bratislava was a damaged husk from after World War II until the end of communism in 1989. The communist regime cared only for the future \u2014 they had no respect for town\u2019s heritage. In the 1950s, they actually sold Bratislava\u2019s original medieval cobbles to cute towns in Germany that were rebuilding with elegant Old World character after World War II.", "With the fall of communism in 1989 began a nearly decade-long process of restitution: The government needed to sort out who had rights to the buildings, and return them to their original owners. During this time, little repair or development took place (since there\u2019s no point investing in a property until ownership is clearly established). It\u2019s hard to imagine today that as recently as the 1990s, Bratislava\u2019s old center was basically a dangerous ghost town.", "By 1998, ownership had finally been sorted out, and the Old Town was made traffic-free. Bratislava has been reborn \u2014 life has returned with a vengeance in the last decade. The only decrepit buildings left in Bratislava are run-down only because they still have ownership issues.", "Slovakia\u2019s huge armaments industry collapsed after communism, leaving it in quite a deep economic hole. But the country\u2019s central location \u2014 with 300 million consumers living within a day\u2019s truck drive \u2014 is ideal for industry. It didn\u2019t take long for the gap left by armaments to be filled by carmakers. Today Slovakia, with five million people, produces one million cars a year. That makes them the world\u2019s top car producers, per capita. Its business environment and relatively unregulated employment code make it easy to hire and easy to fire employees \u2014 which is good for business. Strikes don\u2019t plague the country.", "While the rural parts of the country have dismal unemployment rates, Bratislava has only 2.5 percent unemployment. The measure for standard of living as it relates to local costs puts Bratislava at #10 among European cities. Among post-communist nations, only the Slovaks and the Slovenes have the euro, with Estonia on deck. This is testimony to the wise economic policies the Slovaks have chosen, rather than the populist sweet talk and promises so common elsewhere.", "Slovak kids have incredible opportunity \u2014 unprecedented in this nation\u2019s history. Because of the EU\u2019s Erasmus program, Slovak young people can apply to universities like Cambridge, and be treated like a Brit. And yet, many choose to stay right here.

Magical in its grandeur, this huge building dominates the higgledy-piggledy old town that surrounds it. At its zenith, in the 10th century, the mosque was the center of Western Islam and a cultural hub that rivaled Baghdad and Constantinople.

Everyone spoke the same language, cooked the same dishes, wore the same type of clothes, and shared the same public baths. It was one culture, with three religious traditions.", "\r\n\tBut in 1236, when Christians conquered the city, everything changed. According to legend, one morning Muslims said their last prayers in the great mosque, and that afternoon the Christians set up a portable altar to celebrate their first Mass. Later, as if planting a cross into the mosque's religious heart, they build an imposing cathedral in the middle of the Mezquita.

As you explore, be a keen observer.", "\r\n\tStreets are narrow \u2014 designed to provide much appreciated shade. To keep things even cooler, walls are whitewashed and thick \u2014 providing a kind of natural air-conditioning. To counter the boring whitewash, doors and windows are colorful. Iron grills cover the windows. Historically these were more artistic, now more practical \u2014 a reminder of the persistent gap through the ages between rich and poor. Stone bumpers on corners protected buildings against reckless drivers. As you\u2019ll see, scavenged secondhand ancient Roman pillars worked well. Lanes are made of river-stone cobbles: cheap and local. They provided drains down the middle of a lane while flanked by smooth stones, which stayed dry for walking. Remnants of old towers from minarets survive, built into today\u2019s structures. Muslim C\u00f3rdoba peaked in the 10th century with an estimated 400,000 people...and lots of now-mostly-gone neighborhood mosques.", "\r\n\tIn C\u00f3rdoba, patios are taken very seriously. That\u2019s especially clear each May when a fiercely competitive contest is held to pick the city\u2019s most picturesque. Patios, a common feature of houses throughout Andaluc\u00eda, have a long history here. The Romans used them to cool off, and the Moors added lush, decorative touches. The patio functioned as a quiet outdoor living room, an oasis from the heat. Inside elaborate ironwork gates, roses, geraniums, and jasmine spill down whitewashed walls, while fountains play and caged birds sing. Some patios are owned by individuals, some are communal courtyards for several homes, and some grace public buildings like museums or convents.", "\r\n\tToday, homeowners take pride in these mini-paradises, and have no problem sharing them with tourists. Keep an eye out for square metal signs that indicate historic homes. As you stroll C\u00f3rdoba\u2019s back streets, pop your head into any wooden door that\u2019s open. The owners (who keep their inner black iron gates locked) enjoy showing off their picture-perfect patios. A concentration of C\u00f3rdoba\u2019s previous patio-contest award-winners runs along Calle San Basilio and Calle Mart\u00edn Roa, just across from the Alc\u00e1zar\u2019s gardens.", "\r\n\tWell after midnight, my cultural scavenger hunt is over and the city finally seems quiet. I climb into my bed. Just as I dose off, a noisy and multi-generational parade rumbles down the cobbled lane that I thought promised a good night\u2019s sleep. Standing in my underwear and wrapped in the drapes, I peer secretively out my window. Below a band of guitars and castanets with a choir of those raspy tobacco voices funnels down my narrow alley. Grandmothers \u2014 guardians of a persistent culture \u2014 make sure the children pick up their Andalusian traditions. I feel like a Peeping Tom...until one woman looks up at me, catches my eye, and seems to nod as if satisfied that I was witnessing the persistent richness of their traditional culture.", "\r\n\tStraddling a sharp bend of the Guadalquivir River, C\u00f3rdoba has a glorious Roman and Moorish past, once serving as a regional capital for both empires.

The buildings in this square \u2014 like many Dresden landmarks \u2014 are reconstructed to resemble their pre-bombing facades. At the head of the square, the sprawling Zwinger palace was once the site of lavish royal celebrations hosted by the Wettin dynasty, which ruled Saxony for eight centuries.

Here, I visit the Historic Green Vault. Wettin dynasty big-shot Augustus the Strong began his Baroque treasury collection here in the early 1700s, and the extravagant trove is clearly designed to wow. The ivory, silver, and gold knickknacks are dazzling examples of Gesamtkunstwerk\u00a0\u2014 a symphony of artistic creations, though obnoxiously gaudy by today's tastes. (It's important to reserve tickets in advance; the number of visitors each day is limited to protect the collection.)", "\r\n\tThe highlight of my day is a stop at the symbol and soul of the city: the Frauenkirche (Church of our Lady). After World War II, the Frauenkirche was left a pile of rubble and turned into a peace monument. Only after Germany's 1990 reunification was the decision made to rebuild it completely and painstakingly. Over a decade and \u20ac100 million later, it reopened in 2005. Inside, the circular nave is bright, welcoming, and poignant, featuring a twisted old cross, which had once been the bright golden cross that topped the whole church, but fell 300 feet and burned in the bombing wreckage. Lost until restorers uncovered it from the debris in 1993, it stands exactly on the place where it was found \u2014 still relatively intact. The persistence of this cross symbolizes the themes of the church: rebirth, faith, and resolution.", "\r\n\tThe Frauenkirche towers over the Neumarkt, a once-central square ringed by rich merchants' homes.

Like a massive jigsaw puzzle, the church was painstakingly reassembled using as much of the original stone as possible, and reopened to the public in 2005.

Upon my arrival last night, Pero uncorked a bottle of orahovica (the local walnut liqueur). Hoping to write that evening with a clear head, I tried to refuse the drink. But this is a Slavic land. Remembering times when I was force-fed vodka in Russia by new friends, I knew it was hopeless. Pero had made this hooch himself, with green walnuts. As he slugged down a shot, he handed me a glass, wheezing, \"Walnut grappa \u2014 it recovers your energy.\"", "\r\n\tPero reached under the counter and held up the mangled tail of a mortar shell, describing how the gorgeous stone and knotty-wood building he grew up in suffered a direct hit in the siege. He put the mortar in my hands. Just as I don't enjoy holding a gun, I didn't enjoy touching the twisted remains of that mortar. Pero explained that he gets a monthly retirement check for being wounded in the war, but he got bored and didn't want to live on the tiny government stipend \u2014 so he went to work rebuilding his guesthouse.", "\r\n\tI took Pero's photograph. He held up the mortar and smiled. I didn't want him to hold up the mortar and smile, but that's what he did. He seemed determined to smile \u2014 as if it signified a personal victory over the destruction the mortar had wrought.", "\r\n\tIt's impressive how people can weather tragedy, rebuild, and move on.

Here\u2019s my take:", "First, this is yet another fantastic show. Gorgeously shot by Karel and artfully edited by Steve. I wasn\u2019t sure how we\u2019d cram so much interesting content into one package and still let it breathe, but Steve pulled it off. The sequence near the end, juxtaposing the church and the mosque crowd over pensive music, is about the most powerful thing I\u2019ve seen regarding this conflict. The show succeeds in grappling with the realities of war head-on, without glossing over painful truths, while still being entertaining, easy to comprehend, and a lively travelogue\u2026all this and even-handed, too. Great work, everyone!", "I agree with most of Rick\u2019s suggested cuts. The Sponza Palace can definitely go; the monasteries are also optional, though I find them more interesting/important/pretty than the palace. If we cut both, however, the sightseeing content in Dubrovnik gets very thin; it\u2019d be nice to save one or the other. ", "Rick\u2019s on-camera about the filled-in canal is also somewhat deletable, though I like it. I\u2019d try to keep it unless it\u2019s essential to cut.", "On the whole, when you add up all of your cuts, it seems like Dubrovnik is really being gutted. In your version, Dubrovnik \u2018 which, after all, is the title and main destination of the show \u2018 really gets short shrift. You mention that Dubrovnik is well-worn. Well, maybe for those of us who\u2019ve traveled a lot. But in terms of the TV audience, this is your one and only shot at it, and it\u2019d be a shame to do it halfway. Paris and London are well-worn, but they still deserve to be covered in a TV show as if for the first time. ", "So I\u2019d lobby to keep Pero. I think that sequence is very effective. Pero comes off as likeable and articulate. And it\u2019s very powerful to see the two of you standing in a formerly destroyed house holding a mortar.", "More importantly, big picture: If we cut Pero, we throw off the delicate balance that this show has achieved. When you think about the local people you \u201cinterview,\u201d we\u2019ve currently got a Croat, a Montenegrin, a Serb, and a Muslim. I think it\u2019s critical to afford each group a voice. Including Pero offers a powerful symmetry to this show: We see the gorgeous town of Dubrovnik, then hear about the war from someone who lived through it; later, we see the pretty town of Mostar, then hear about the war from someone who lived through it. If we leave out Pero, the only real talk of Croats is as the aggressors in Mostar. I think it\u2019s essential to also show a Croat (Pero) as a resilient victim. Pero also personalizes the war in Dubrovnik in a pretty dramatic way.", "So what\u2019s to be done? It\u2019s clear to me that \u2018 both in terms of the quality of the sequences, and in terms of the overall balance of the show \u2018 the most expendable bit is Cetinje. If you simply cut everything after the explanation of the name \u201cBlack Mountain,\u201d it\u2019s a tidy transition out of the country. ", "I really like Stefan, and I\u2019d be very sorry to see him go. And, Rick, I know you have an affection for Cetinje. But let\u2019s be honest: Cetinje is neither particularly attractive, nor historically interesting. At best, it\u2019s a depressed, once-great town that gets a quirky footnote in history. And the church/monastery Stefan guides you through pales in comparison to the one in Trebinje. It feels like one Orthodox church too many (especially right in a row). I\u2019d rather have an articulate, philosophizing priest explaining a gorgeous Orthodox church than a tour guide explaining a hokey artifact in a blah one. If you\u2019re trying to flesh out a thin show, that\u2019s one thing. But we have the opposite problem. If anything should get short shrift in this overstuffed show, it\u2019s Montenegro \u2018 not Dubrovnik.", "Getting back to the issue of providing balance: If we take out Stefan, we\u2019ve still got a Croat (Pero), a Serb (Father Drazen), and a Muslim (Alma). That feels right to me, as you promise in the opening OC, \u201cWe\u2019ll get to know three major groups of the former Yugoslavia \u2018 Croats, Serbs, and Muslims.\u201d", "If we cut Cetinje, it should get us closer to the time we need.

", "\u2013The section with my lines conveys a lot of hard-to-digest content and is pretty dense. But we could cherry-pick a few lines in there to cut. For example, the explanation of why these wars happened (age-old hatreds vs. manipulative politicians) is an important point, but difficult to convey succinctly. It could go.", "\u2013I can see where it might work to trim down Alma\u2019s talk in the cemetery, if you want, and cover some of that with your voice-over.", "Rick, I feel strongly about the Cetinje issue. I really think cutting Cetinje would make this a more powerful show \u2018 and a more balanced, nuanced, and thought-provoking one.", "I hope this helps.

I agree that the kid in the Cetinje church is cuttable, and the bit about pluralism. So, please, cut all but Pero in Dub, cut the church (only) in Cetinje, and cut just the line about pluralism.

After taking into consideration both yours and Cameron\u2019s comments, I\u2019d like to make my own case. I agree with Cameron\u2019s proposal to cut Cetinje entirely for the reasons he states, and cutting just the church/relic sequence makes Cetinje even more unnecessary in the show. If we cut all of Cetinje we drop 1:25. In terms of Dubrovnik, I would cut the monasteries and art because I feel they are less than impressive and doing so would connect your previous on-camera to the walls of Dubrovnik better (the OC was about the period when Dubrovnik was growing/becoming prominent, and the walls are the most visible and impressive sign of that). Losing the monasteries and art would cut around another 30 seconds. And I also feel very strongly that we should keep Pero in the show. Finally, I agree with Cameron\u2019s suggested trim of Father Drazen when he speaks of pluralism. Depending on where I cut it, that gets us somewhere between 15 and 25 seconds. That puts us right in the pocket, time-wise. I can probably get it to time after that with my usual final pass of trims and fine cutting. I think this would make the best show and get me where I need to be time-wise. I\u2019ll look into where your proposed cuts would leave us in terms of show length, Rick.

Knox's influence was huge. His insistence that every person should be able to read the word of God firsthand helped give Scotland an educational system 300 years ahead of the rest of Europe. A dramatic stained-glass window shows the commotion that surrounded Knox when he preached. With his hand on the holy book, Knox seems to conduct divine electricity to the Scottish faithful packing the church.", "\r\n\tJust down the road from St. Giles' is the John Knox House, featuring atmospheric rooms, period furniture, and a fun little dress-up corner that lets me play out my great reformer fantasy. And just past the John Knox House are two enjoyable stops: Lickety Splits Gallery and Cadenhead's Whisky Shop.", "\r\n\tAt Lickety Splits, Naomi sells traditional candies and local crafts.

Popping in, I'm shown a shelf of aged wooden casks. The shop owner explains, \"A single cask whisky is like a football team where all the players come from the same town.\" Sipping this whisky with an expert, I see why Scots call this drink \"a very good friend.\"", "\r\n\tFortified, I continue down the Royal Mile. Finally, after centuries of history, I've reached modern times: the Scottish parliament building. After 300 years of being ruled from London, the Scots regained their own parliament in 1999, and a few years later built this striking, eco-friendly home for it. This soaring building mixes wild angles, lots of light, bold windows, oak, and local stone into a startling complex that seems to be surging right out of the rock of Arthur's Seat, the craggy summit just beyond the base of the Royal Mile. For a conversation starter, ask a local what he or she thinks about the building. To get a peek inside and a lesson in how the Scottish Parliament works, drop in, pass through security, and find the visitors' desk. You're welcome in the public parts of the building, including the impressive Debating Chambers.", "\r\n\tMy last stop is the Palace of Holyroodhouse, one of Queen Elizabeth's official residences and the home of Scottish royalty, including James IV and Mary, Queen of Scots. The Scottish monarchs also kept a home at the top end of the Mile, but they preferred the cushier Holyroodhouse to the blustery castle on the rock.", "\r\n\tI've soaked up plenty of Scottish history on my walk from castle to palace.

Today the building houses a museum that tells the story of the babies left there.", "\r\n\tBrunelleschi also designed another less-visited sight \u2014 the Basilica of San Lorenzo, which has a surprisingly plain exterior.

They were great rivals of the Medici, and when the Strozzi built their massive rusticated house in the 1490s, they basically copied the Medici's nearby palace. Considering how the Strozzi name gave Italian its words for loan shark (strozzino) and strangle (strozzare), their loans must have come with some aggressive banking practices.

Many of these tabernacles still find flowers and candles placed before them, attesting to their continued function for contemporary Florentines.", "\r\n\tThere are also curious tiny arched openings adjacent to the massive entrance doors of many buildings in Florence. Such small porte del vino, or \"wine doors,\" were used by the Florentine families who lived in these palaces to display their agricultural products for sale, most notably wine. Any Florentine family of note, naturally, had a house in the city as well as agricultural land out in the countryside. For me, these openings are sad reminders that once upon a time, a stroll through Florence could be done with a glass of Chianti in hand. Luckily, today's Florence still has plenty of wine shops \u2014 and there's usually one close at hand offering samples in the afternoon.", "\r\n\tBut back to the streets. Other finds include the marble plaques that can be found on various Florentine buildings at a height of about 20 feet (usually at the level of the street lamps affixed to the buildings). These plaques might commemorate passages from Dante or note an important person who once lived in the building. They might record important events, both true \u2014 the ones that indicate the level of the water of the 1966 flood seem to be everywhere, even in the stairwell of my apartment building \u2014 and not-so-true, such as the one affixed to the church of Santi Apostoli that records the foundation of that structure by Charlemagne.", "\r\n\tSome of my favorite such plaques, however, are the ones that record civil statutes and the rules of proper comportment for a given place. For example, in Piazza Calamandrei, one is reminded to behave decently; in Piazza del Giglio, one is not to play ball or other games; in Piazza Strozzi, one is warned not to sell watermelons or other fruit, on pain of a five-lire fine. If you happen to be a prostitute, you are kindly invited not to live in Via dei Pepi \u2014 or you'll face arrest. The plaque on the Palazzo Vecchio behind the familiar (and recently vandalized) Neptune fountain forbids us from doing our laundry in the fountain.", "\r\n\tNext time you're in Florence, look for these \"street finds,\" and you'll find a wealth of detail about how the regular Florentine lived and lives.\u00a0", "\r\n\tJane Zaloga is a scholar of architectural history and docent for Context Florence.", "\r\n\tThe Accademia Gallery in Florence is a temple of humanism.

Its flair for art and unpretentious friendliness make it more popular than ever to visit.", "\r\n\tYou can sense Glasgow's wonderful energy on its streets and squares. At the heart of the city is George Square, decorated with a Who's Who of statues depicting great Scots, from Sir Walter Scott to James Watt, who perfected the steam engine that helped power Europe into the Industrial Age.", "\r\n\tNearby is Buchanan Street, part of a pedestrian shopping zone called the Golden Zed (Brit-speak for \"Z,\" named for the way it zigzags through town).

During the late 1800s and early 1900s, Glasgow-born architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh brought an exuberant Art Nouveau influence to this otherwise practical, working-class city. Travelers can enjoy his work (and a meal) at the Willow Tea Rooms, a delightful black-and-white space that Mackintosh designed right down to the furniture, lighting, and cutlery. But his crowning achievement is the Glasgow School of Art. Still a working school, it's usually viewable via a guided tour (it recently closed following a fire, and isn't expected to reopen until 2018, at the earliest).

The city, so layered with rich history, was officially named \"Istanbul\" in 1923 with the founding of the modern Turkish Republic. Before that it was called \"Constantinople.\" Around A.D. 330, as ancient Rome was falling, Emperor Constantine moved the capital to the less chaotic east. It was named Constantinople in his honor. Then, in 476, Rome and the Western Empire fell to invading barbarians.", "\r\n\tTraces of the Roman capital remain in Istanbul. The Hippodrome was a racetrack, like Rome's Circus Maximus. Built in the fourth century, this square was Constantinople's primary venue for chariot races. Its centerpiece, a 3,500-year-old Egyptian obelisk, was originally carved to honor a pharaoh. What you see today is only the upper third of the original massive stone tower.", "\r\n\tThe best look at ancient Constantinople is the Hagia Sophia, considered one of the greatest houses of worship in both the Christian and Muslim worlds (today it's a museum). Built in the sixth century, this church marked the pinnacle of the Byzantine glory days, boasting the biggest dome anywhere until Florence's cathedral was finished 900 years later. After the Byzantine Empire collapsed in the 15th century, the Ottomans turned it into a mosque, adding minarets and plastering over Christian mosaics. The prayer niche was shifted a bit off-center so it would point toward Mecca, rather than Jerusalem.", "\r\n\tFacing the Hagia Sophia is the Blue Mosque.

One time, I visited in the evening, when once again it was the neighborhood mosque in action \u2014 not a tourist in sight. A window was open for ventilation. I peeked through to find it was the ladies' prayer zone.

During this time, the Muslim faith seems even more vivid and engaging. It's a struggle just to walk down the street during prayer time, as people spill out of neighborhood mosques, their carpets unfurled on sidewalks.

Since Ramadan takes place during the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, it occurs at different times of the year. When Ramadan takes place in summer, as it does this year, fasting is more challenging because of the longer, hot days. Still, people take it seriously. Once, while sucking sweet apple tobacco from a water pipe, I offered my waiter a puff of my hookah. He put his hand over his heart and explained he'd love to, but he couldn't until the sun went down.", "\r\n\tNot every Muslim fasts during Ramadan. For instance, exemptions are granted to young children, pregnant women, the sick, and the elderly.

Restaurants that have been empty all day are suddenly marked by long lines stretching down the street.

The Blue Mosque's courtyard turns into a huge market with religious books, computer programs, and even teen wear for sale. Young girls make head scarves fashionable. Sticky treats shine under swinging lamps. Turkish coffee burbles in copper kettles buried deep in red coals. Hourglass-shaped tea glasses are the perfect fit for Turkish hands. Seeing the twinkling lights strung up in honor of Ramadan, I think, \"Charming \u2014 they've draped Christmas lights between the minarets.\" Then I realize that a Turk might come to my house in December and say, \"Charming \u2014 he's draped Ramadan lights on his Christmas tree.\"", "\r\n\tSleep is an afterthought during this time.

Before entering, you must park your shoes at the door and women must cover their heads. If they don't have a scarf, there are loaners at the door. Muslims also wash their hands and feet at a fountain before they enter a mosque.", "\r\n\tInside, countless beautiful tiles feature exquisite floral and geometric motifs. Rather than saints and prophets, geometrical designs and calligraphy are used as adornment because Muslims believe the portrayal of people in places of worship draws attention away from worshipping Allah as the one God.", "\r\n\tMuslims pray five times a day. According to tradition, the imam, or prayer leader, would climb to the top of a minaret (like a church's bell tower) to call the faithful to prayer. These days, the prayer leader still performs the call to prayer live, but it's amplified by loudspeakers at the top of the minarets. When this happens, practicing Muslims drop into a mosque, turn toward Mecca, kneel face down, and pray to God. After a short service of praise, workaday life resumes.", "\r\n\tWherever I travel, having just a grasp of the dominant local religion makes the people and traditions I encounter more meaningful and enjoyable.

But then the Grand Bazaar was discovered by travelers seeking the ultimate \"Oriental market\" experience.

This can be intimidating, but it's fun if you loosen up and approach it with a sense of humor. The main rule of thumb: Don't feel compelled to look at or buy anything you don't want. These salesmen prey on Americans' gregariousness, and our tendency to respond politely to anyone who offers us a friendly greeting.

We bivouacked in Amir Kabir, the vagabond hotel district, where travelers stranded along the freak road to India kill time. Hidden behind piles of tires and used auto parts lurked countless dirt-cheap no-name hotels. Rooms were decorated in the local style: smashed bugs, broken windows, cigarette butts stuck in sooty holes in the walls, and bare dangling 20 watt light bulbs. We had joined a community of India-bound travelers, living in their rooms like animals in caves, running around in sweaty underpants and bare feet. There we sat, exhausted, methodically pinching bugs as they waded through the hair on our legs.

I started to struggle with the wisdom of this trip. I would never be satisfied until I had traveled overland to India. But I didn't want to endure several weeks of hell only to spend a fortune to fly back to Europe. Still hot under my dry-again sheet but protected from the bugs, I fell asleep thinking it was not too late to return to Europe. In three days, maybe five, it could be baklava in the Greek Island sun.", "\r\n\tBut we pushed on. Meshad was a Muslim carnival. Our first taste of Afghanistan was the Meshad bus station. It seemed a jumping-off place for lands beyond this planet. Things seemed more Mongolian than Iranian. The station was strewn with humble bundles and people who seemed more in need of a camel than a bus. Gene was dealing with a little Tehran Tummy. We boarded our Afghan bus pensive and weak. With gritty hairdryer wind blowing in my face, I dreamed out my window. At the same time I hoped the kilometers would tick by quickly, I regretted plunging farther and farther away from Europe. But with so much parched earth behind us, we had no choice but to think of India as Gene and I sang a shaky verse of \"Homeward Bound.\"", "\r\n\tWe were about a week beyond Istanbul and only half way to India. At 10 am we actually hit the \"middle of nowhere,\" a huddle of concrete block buildings which marked the Iran-Afghanistan border. Surrendering our passports we were taken into a waiting room. An interesting mini-museum greeted us with a stern message. Several glass cases displayed the sobering stories of fifteen or twenty ill-fated drug smuggling tourists. It made for interesting reading \u2014 who smuggled what, where they tried to hide it, and how much more time they'd spend rotting in a prison. One of our guidebooks actually had a fine print appendix listing assorted First World prisoners who needed blankets, medicine, and so on. I had this clammy fear that someone would plant some dope in my rucksack.", "\r\n\tAfter zipping through Iranian customs we walked across a windy desert no-man's-land to a tiny settlement bordered by stripped, abandoned VW vans where local people piled into and onto small orange busses. The wind and heat were fierce, and the barren plain stretched out in every direction. Gene commented, \"So this is Afghanistan.\" In the shade of a wrecked, rusted Microbus we peeled an apple and waited for the bank and doctor's office to open. The next few hours tried my patience as we bounced from one dusty office to the next, jumping through hoop after hoop of Afghanistan bureaucracy. It seems that Gene was missing a vaccination. No problem, they were delighted to inject him right there. It was tough to watch the needle bend as the nurse forced its well-used tip into Gene's flesh. Finally we squirted out into the vast Afghan wasteland.", "\r\n\tWe piled into waiting mini-buses. It was the only way to get to the only place you could reach from here \u2014 Herat, the first town in Afghanistan. The empty, well-paved road shot like an arrow past random clusters of mud huts, a few \"melted sand castle\" ruins, seemingly lost herds of sheep and goats, and into the parched, pristine mountain backdrop.", "\r\n\tJust when I thought this was going smoothly, a commotion broke out in the front of the bus. The Afghan driver decided to double the price of the ride. We road-to-India travelers were a principled bunch and refused. One leathery Afghan pulled out a knife that could filet a goat, and the driver turned around and headed back for the Iranian border. In an uproar, everyone tried to solve the problem. One polite but loud Pakistani urged us to pay, but we figured if we did that they would just extort us again. Compromising, we agreed to pay 50% extra upon arrival in Herat, and the driver turned back toward Herat.", "\r\n\tWe stopped at a desolate tea shop. Next to a well, a bunch of locals were skinning a still-warm goat. There was a sign that read \"Hotel\" and I expected the worst. But this was just an innocent mid-day tea stop which provided Gene and me with our first good look at Afghan life. We cooled down under well-buckets of brown water before sharing a melon. Feeling a bit road-weary, we promised each other that from now on we'd eat well and sleep in good hotels to stay healthy and keep our spirits high.", "\r\n\tThe tea house was classic Afghanistan...old rag-wrapped men, who looked like they worked hard all their lives sat around on rugs drinking tea and smoking hashish. The room was filled with smoke. Their glassy dark eyes smiled at nobody in particular. I stood silently over my melon rinds looking in the window like I was watching a documentary on TV. The word spread...our driver was high as a kite. No one was surprised.", "\nBack on the hot bus to Herat, it dawned on us \"Yes, this is completely different \u2014 and it's starting to look good.\" I punched Gene playfully on the shoulder and said, \"OK, now our trip begins!\" As our guidebook predicted, Herat was hard not to like. We checked into the best hotel in town-the place where the locals celebrate their weddings. The hotel menu featured marked-down prices and a note: \"Since the People's Revolution, all prices are lowered by 10 afs.\"", "\r\n\t\t\t\tStanding on our balcony, hair fluffy, teeth clean, stomachs filled, stools nearly solid, we surveyed Herat. Flower bedecked horse drawn chariots charged through the streets past soldiers and police safeguarding the recent revolution. The elderly cleaning man stood on the next balcony. I told him we needed some toilet paper and he said dreamily, \"Yes, it is very beautiful.\" We stood still, as the sun melted into the purple mountains.", "\r\n\t\t\t\tLike good girls save themselves, I had proudly never smoked anything illegal in the USA. But Afghanistan seemed like the time and place to lose this virginity. Gene had stumbled onto some marijuana and, in the privacy of our room, he stuffed it into a tiny wooden pipe. He took a drag, immediately remarking \"Good stuff.\" I sucked in, not knowing what to expect and hoping not to get a mouthful of ashes. Nothing happened, but it felt fine. I had inhaled. Smoking more, we had dinner and took a walk.", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNow the kaleidoscope of Afghanistan invited us in. Colors and objects were more tangy. Torch-lit chariots charged through the darkness, men carried lanterns, shopkeepers and their work boys squatted around soup and bread, the wind howled but the night was warm. Mingling was intensified. Local life was suddenly carbonated with little scenes. A man weighed wonderfully back-lit tomatoes. The call to prayer rode its carpet without the harshness. Street urchins still bothered me, but as nieces and nephews rather than money-grubbing strangers. And passing time became, by definition, productive. I don't know if that was because of the marijuana or because I was in a very good mood. I really didn't feel \"high.\" I was swimming in Afghanistan and liking it.", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe crossed Afghanistan by bus, didn't like Kabul (which fits the country like a tin can in a terrarium), and readied ourselves for the Khyber Pass. Crossing this romantically wild and historically dangerous pass was high on my life's checklist of things to do. Now I wa", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\ts sitting in a brightly but badly painted old bus. I had a panorama window which opened as wide as the countryside. The bus was filled with Pakistanis and western \"freak road\" travelers.

For four hours they stared at me as if I was a TV and this was their first look.", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter an hour-long sit at the border, ignoring persistent black-market merchants pedaling out-dated (and therefore worthless) paper currency and vials of cocaine, we crossed into Pakistan and began our climb up the much-fought-over Khyber Pass. Hanging out the window, I tried to take in everything, every wild turn in the road, every fortress-crowned hill, every stray goat, every gaily-painted truck and every mud hut pimpling the landscape. Dry rocky graveyards with wind-tattered flags littered the hillsides, clouds threatened, and life-worn people crouched atop tiny stone fortresses. If ever the world's most wanted man wanted to hide out...this would be the ideal place.", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe were moving out of the parched Arab side of South Asia and into the wet Indian sub-continent. From now on we would feel muggy but enjoy a lush countryside. Our bus ticket had a \"safe passage supplement\" which we all paid. This was collected by a rifle-toting guard positioned just over this semi-autonomous pass. We were in Waziristan \u2014 an autonomous district, not governable by Pakistan...notorious for its independent spirit.", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe pulled into Peshawar \u2014 claimed, if not ruled, by Pakistan. The humidity \u2014 novel after Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan \u2014 seemed to connect us with the powerful magnet of India. We caught the first train east. Twelve hours of first class for $1.50 extra seemed like a good investment, as we got padded seats and less crowds (which, we were to learn, came with a downside: less flesh to spread around for the bugs).", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHot muggy air carried soot from the steam engine through the open window. Bugs came out with the stars. The lights on the train worked like on my old bike; the slower you go the dimmer they glow. It was a dim train. The only thing fast about it was the clouds of bugs that seemed right at home. Like a horse swatting flies in his sleep, I spent the night rolling bugs through my sooty hairs until they disappeared.", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe awoke energized by the last sprint to the Indian border. There's something weirdly home-like about India, even if you've never been there. We both felt strangely and strongly that we were going home. Words can't explain the joy we felt stepping across that happy tree-lined border. For years, enchanted India had commanded prime time in my travel dreams. Two years in a row, I found excuses to go elsewhere instead. Finally, and thankfully, I had the nerve to make this happen.", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStrolling past turbaned Sikhs, wallowing water buffalo and lush green fields, I felt great. I had opened a new world and rekindled the travel flame that Europe alone could no longer fuel.", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBut Kashmir, the promised end of our rainbow, was still a two day train bus trek away. A powerful current pulls travelers north from India's mucky heat to the blissful Vale of Kashmir. The last stretch is 300 kilometers of narrow switch-backs spiced with dreadful cliffs, huge falling boulders, lots of top-heavy trucks and military vehicles, and constant signs reminding divers (as only Indian signs can) to be careful, with cheerful slogans such as \"Drive carefully, your family needs you\" or \"Better late than dead.\" The terrain became almost tropical as we worked up to a scenic climax. Finally, we went through a long dark one-lane tunnel. When we popped out, we were greeted by a cheery sign announcing \"Welcome to Kashmir. You are now in Paradise.\"", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe treacherous road became a garden drive through a Mona Lisa landscape. By the time we settled into our decaying Victorian houseboat, we understood what the sign was saying. Climbing to the rooftop, we sank deep into wicker chairs for tea and surveyed our promised land. Below us families sliced silently by in dug-out canoes. The thin air made me feel like breaking my biscuits on the cut glass Himalayan peaks that surrounded us.

This holy month, where Muslim people refrain from eating during daylight hours, is set by the lunar Islamic calendar. The fasting is intended to turn the heart away from the world and toward God.

Yet a tourist unfamiliar with Islam might not notice that practicing Muslims are not eating or even drinking.", "\r\n\tIf you visit during Ramadan, you'll wake to the call to prayer and the sounds of a convivial meal just before dawn. The sun rises and the day-long fast begins. Then, at about 7 p.m., food comes out, and the nightly festival begins. Mohammad broke his fast with a dried date or olive \u2014 and that remains the most common fast-breaker.

Throughout my Ramadan visit, every time I watched the end of the fast, people offered to share their food.

I thought the Coke was a bit odd...but they said it's not considered American anymore. It's truly global.", "\r\n\tLike Ramadan, prayer is a pillar of the Islamic faith. Tourists in Istanbul hear the call to prayer five times a day. According to tradition, as the sun prepares to rise, an imam stares at his arm. When he can tell a gray hair from a black one, it's time to call his parish to the morning prayer. While the quality and warble varies, across the land the Arabic words of the call are exactly the same, starting with: \"God is great.\"", "\r\n\tThey say tiny mosques can't afford a real musician, so the imam himself does the singing \u2014 not always top-quality. Big mosques have a trained professional singer. Anyone can hear the qualitative difference. To the non-Muslim ear, the call to prayer sounds like coyotes howling in a cacophony.

You'll see legendary figures from the days of King Kazimierz, the famous astronomer Copernicus, and even the region's favorite son, Pope John Paul II.

The people of Leipzig were at the forefront of the so-called \u201cPeaceful Revolution\u201d that toppled the post-war Communist government. The famous scenes of Berliners joyfully partying atop the Wall were made possible by lesser-known protests that began in Leipzig in 1982.

My guide\u2019s wife, who had participated in the quiet rebellion, spoke of leaving the church cupping candles to let the soldiers know they were unarmed.

The lyrics reflect the pining for a loved one across the water, hopes for a future reunion, remembrances a rosy past or dreams of a better future, and the yearning for what might have been if fate had not intervened. While generally sad, fado can be jaunty...but in a nostalgic way. Fado can also be bright and happy when the song is about the virtues of cities such as Lisbon or Coimbra, or of the warmth of a typical Portuguese home.", "\r\n\tThe songs are often in a minor key. The singer (fadista) is accompanied by a 12-string guitarra portuguesa (with a round body like a mandolin) or other stringed instruments unique to Portugal.

The museum is located at the base of the Alfama, the most colorful neighborhood in town (and the best for informal fado bars).", "\r\n\tWhile fado has become one of Lisbon's favorite late-night tourist traps, it's easy to find a funky bar \u2014 without the high prices and big-bus tour groups \u2014 that still feels very local.

But even after the summer games were safely tucked away in the record books, their legacy lives on in East London. While definitely not Jolly Olde England, this area \u2014 stretching from the Olympic Park south to the bustling Docklands district \u2014 offers a break from quaint, touristy London and a refreshing look at the British version of a 21st-century city.", "\r\n\tThe gleaming new Olympic Park is located about seven miles northeast of downtown London in an area called Stratford. Filling the Lea Valley, Stratford was once the site of derelict factories, mountains of discarded tires, and Europe's biggest refrigerator dump. But in preparation for the Olympics, this area was gutted and rebuilt. Half a million trees were planted, and 1.4 million tons of dirt were cleansed of arsenic, lead, and other toxic chemicals \u2014 a reminder of this site's dirty industrial past.", "\r\n\tOlympic Park is huge \u2014 bigger than Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens. It's also quite beautiful, laced with canals and tributaries of the Lea River.

While some buildings, such as the basketball and water-polo arenas, are being dismantled, others will gain a second life. For instance, Olympic Stadium will become a more intimate venue with 60,000 seats while the velodrome will be turned into a center for community use. The Olympic Village dorms will become units for public housing. The commercial zone, Stratford City, is the biggest shopping center in Europe, while the Olympic Park area is now a public space called the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\u00a0", "\r\n\tJust south of Stratford, the Docklands, is another reinvigorated East London neighborhood. Back when Britannia ruled the waves, the Docklands boasted the world's biggest shipping harbor, with a prime spot on the Thames River. Then, after being destroyed by German bombers during World War II, the Docklands became a dangerous no-man's-land. Until a generation ago, local surveys ranked it as one of the least desirable places to call home. It's said that for every Tube stop you lived east of central London, your life expectancy dropped one year.", "\r\n\tThese days, the Docklands is a thriving center of business and my nomination for Europe's most impressive urban development. Wandering around this area \u2014 filled with skyscrapers, subterranean supermalls, trendy pubs, and peaceful parks with pedestrian bridges looping over canals \u2014 is like discovering a slick, futuristic version of Manhattan with an English accent. My favorite time to visit is at the end of the workday, when the area comes alive with office workers finally ready to relax and let loose.", "\r\n\tDespite its modern vibe, the Docklands retains remnants of the past. You can still see the 19th-century brown-brick warehouses that were once used for trading sugar and rum. Today they host a row of happening restaurants along with the excellent Museum of London Docklands, which takes visitors on a fascinating 2,000-year walk through the story of commerce on the Thames.", "\r\n\tBetween its historic neighborhoods, centuries-old churches, and blockbuster museums, London is filled with can't-miss sights. But if you want to say you've seen today's London, head east for a little modern history \u2014 and a fresh and contemporary take on this multilayered city.", "\r\n\tMost new visitors to London are amazed at how \"un-English\" it feels. Chinese take-outs outnumber fish-and-chip shops, many hotels are run by people with a foreign ancestry, and curry is the \"local\" specialty. But there's at least one place in London that's straight out of jolly olde England \u2014 the pub.", "\r\n\tThe pub is the heart of the people's England, where all manner of folks have, for generations, found their respite from work and a home-away-from-home. England's classic pubs are national treasures, with great cultural value and rich history, not to mention good beer and grub.", "\r\n\tCrawling between London's classic pubs is more than a tipsy night out \u2014 it's bona fide sightseeing. The city's most characteristic pubs range from places where Shakespeare could have made merry to classy 20th-century revivals. Each offer a glimpse \u2014 and a taste \u2014 of traditional English culture.", "\r\n\tTheir odd names can go back hundreds of years. Because so many medieval pub-goers were illiterate, pubs were simply named for the picture hung outside (e.g., The Crooked Stick, The Queen's Arms \u2014 meaning her coat of arms).", "\r\n\tThe Golden Age for pub-building was in the late Victorian era (c. 1880\u20131905), when pubs were independently owned and land prices were high enough to make it worthwhile to invest in fixing up pubs. The politics were pro-pub as well: Conservatives, backed by Big Beer, were in, and temperance-minded Liberals were out.", "\r\n\tEspecially in class-conscious Victorian times, traditional pubs were divided into sections by elaborate screens (now mostly gone), allowing the wealthy to drink in a more refined setting, while commoners congregated on the pub's rougher side. These were really \"public houses,\" featuring nooks (snugs) for groups and clubs to meet, friends and lovers to rendezvous, and families to get out of the house at night.", "\r\n\tHistoric pubs still dot the London cityscape. The only place to see the very oldest-style tavern in the \"domestic tradition\" is at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese (145 Fleet Street), which was rebuilt in 1667 (after the Great Fire) from a 16th-century tavern. I like to imagine this mazelike place, with three separate bars, in the pre-Victorian era: With no bar, drinkers gathered around the fireplaces, while tap boys shuttled tankards up from the cellar. (This was long before barroom taps were connected to casks in the cellar. Oh, and don't say \"keg\" \u2014 that's a gassy modern thing.)", "\r\n\tLate-Victorian pubs are more common, such as the lovingly restored 1897 Princess Louise (208 High Holborn). These places are fancy, often with heavy embossed wallpaper ceilings, decorative tile work, fine-etched glass, ornate carved stillions (the big central hutch for storing bottles and glass), and even urinals equipped with a place to set your glass.", "\r\n\tLondon's best Art Nouveau pub is The Black Friar (c. 1900\u20131915), with fine carved capitals, lamp holders, and quirky phrases worked into the decor (174 Queen Victoria Street).", "\r\n\tThe \"former-bank pubs\" represent a more modern trend in pub-building. As banks increasingly go electronic, they're moving out of lavish, high-rent old buildings. Many of these former banks are being refitted as pubs with elegant bars and freestanding stillions, which provide a fine centerpiece. Three such pubs are The Old Bank of England (194 Fleet Street), The Jugged Hare (172 Vauxhall Bridge Road), and The Counting House (50 Cornhill).", "\r\n\tPub grub is better than it sounds, and getting tastier every year. Pubs often serve traditional dishes, such as \"bangers and mash\" (sausages and mashed potatoes) and roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, but you're just as likely to find pasta, curried dishes, and quiche on the menu.", "\r\n\tAnd, of course, there's the number-one reason people have always flocked to pubs: beer \u2014 and the British take great pride in their brews. Many Brits think that drinking beer cold and carbonated, as Americans do, ruins the taste. Most pubs will have lagers (cold, refreshing, American-style beer), ales (amber-colored, cellar-temperature beer), bitters (hop-flavored ale, perhaps the most typical British beer), and stouts (dark and somewhat bitter, like Guinness). At pubs, long-handled pulls are used to pull the traditional, rich-flavored \"real ales\" up from the cellar. These are the connoisseur's favorites: fermented naturally, varying from sweet to bitter, often with a hoppy or nutty flavor. Notice the fun names. Short-handled pulls at the bar mean colder, fizzier, mass-produced, and less interesting keg beers. Mild beers are sweeter, with a creamy malt flavoring. Irish cream ale is a smooth, sweet experience. Try the draft cider (sweet or dry)...carefully.", "\r\n\tSpend some time in any of these pubs today and you'll have your finger on the pulse of London. These cozy hang-outs are an extended living room, where locals and travelers alike can eat, drink, get out of the rain, watch a sporting event, and make new friends. Like in days past, people go to a pub to be social. If that's your aim, stick by the bar (rather than a table) and people will assume you're in the mood to talk. Go pubbing in the evening for a lively time, or drop by during the quiet late morning (from 11:00), when the pub is empty and filled with memories.", "\r\n\tWith 600 square miles, eight million people, and too many must-see sights to see, London can be formidable. On my last visit, I was up for the challenge. I blitzed the city from the second I arrived. After landing at Heathrow, I rode the Tube to my hotel, dropped off my bag, and hit the ground running.", "\r\n\tFirst I dashed to the Natural History Museum. Upon entering, I quickly remembered how much I love this place. In the main hall a sculpted Charles Darwin sat on his throne below a giant slice of sequoia. Rooms were closed not \"for renovation,\" but because \"we are evolving.\" Things were put in perspective: The elephant was big, but it looked like it could have been a dangling charm on the sperm whale's charm bracelet. In the mineral vault, a chunk of Mars came with an explanation of how it got here.", "\r\n\tNext I popped into the always-thrilling Victoria and Albert Museum. It has always featured one of the world's top collections of decorative arts \u2014 vases, stained glass, jewelry, and fine furniture. And after the V&A, I ate dinner at my favorite pub \u2014 it was a super start to my visit.", "\r\n\tHere are some tips I've learned over the years. Public transportation is the most efficient way to get around this huge city. For a week-long stay, spring for the Seven-Day Travelcard, which zips you to most of the top sights for one flat fee. For this visit, rather than spend \u00a350 for a taxi from Heathrow to my South Kensington hotel, I paid about \u00a330 for a seven-day Travelcard transit pass, which not only covered my airport-into-town Tube ride, but gave me unlimited Tube and bus rides for a week.", "\r\n\tWhile the Travelcard fulfills most transportation needs, a double-decker bus tour is still a classic London experience. I recommend saving this for a Sunday morning, when many sights are closed, making this a convenient time to get an overview of the city. If you hop on the bus early enough, you can get off at Buckingham Palace in time to catch the Changing of the Guard at 11:30.", "\r\n\tLondon is one of Europe's most expensive cities, and sightseeing can add up quickly. But many of the city's top museums are free (though donations are requested). These include the Victoria and Albert, British Library, British Museum, National Gallery, and Tate Modern.", "\r\n\tThere are certainly sights that charge admission \u2014 but if you can't save money, save time. For no extra fee, souvenir stands and the City of London tourist information office sell \"Fast Track\" tickets that allow you to skip the queue at certain sights. These are especially worthwhile for places that can have long ticket lines, such as the Tower of London, the London Eye, and Madame Tussauds.", "\r\n\tIf you're having trouble fitting everything in, evenings can be a great time to sightsee. On any night of the week, you'll find some sights open until at least 8 or 9 p.m. During the height of summer, you can hang with waxy celebs at Madame Tussauds into the evening or whirl on the London Eye until 9:30 any night.", "\r\n\tA good itinerary shouldn't just cover the big sights. You're on vacation, remember? Some of my favorite London experiences don't involve art, royalty, or artifacts; instead, they're about enjoying a picnic lunch while cruising the Thames; watching Londoners at play in Hyde Park; sipping afternoon tea at the Wolseley; or browsing through the street market in Notting Hill or Camden Town.", "\r\n\tIn the evenings, take advantage of London's theater scene, which rivals Broadway in quality and usually beats it in price (try for discounted same-day tickets at the \"tkts\" booth in Leicester Square). Between high-energy musicals in the West End, cutting-edge plays starring A-list celebrities, and Shakespearean productions at the Globe, London's theater will have the perfect show for you.", "\r\n\tIn my view, London is one of the only cities in Europe (along with Rome, Paris, and Istanbul) that can fill an entire week with blockbuster sights and experiences. It's impossible to see it all in one shot, so why try? Countless visits later, I still leave here with a healthy list of reasons to return.", "\r\n\tLondon dazzles year-round, but for a true \u201cback door\u201d experience, consider visiting in winter, when airfares and hotel rates are generally cheaper \u2014 and there are fewer tourists.", "\r\n\tLondon\u2019s a super one-week getaway, with sights that can keep even the most fidgety traveler well entertained. As an off-season adventurer, you can wander alone through the National Gallery, gaze at the crown jewels undisturbed, and be the only one trying to talk to stiff-lipped guards at Buckingham Palace. In wintertime London, you\u2019ll stroll beneath Big Ben and wonder, \u201cWhere are the tourists?\u201d", "\r\n\tDespite the short days and dreary weather, Londoners have plenty of reasons to go outdoors this time of year. One of the coolest wintertime activities \u2014 literally \u2014 is to don some skates and hit one of the outdoor ice rinks around town. Somerset House and the Tower of London are considered the Rockefeller Center of ice rinks \u2014 but they\u2019re even better because you get to glide alongside the facade of a grand Neoclassical building or under the shadow of London\u2019s most famous prison and execution site. (Be thankful that the blades are on your feet, not above your head.) Ice rinks also sprawl in front of the Natural History Museum and Hampton Court Palace.", "\r\n\tSpeaking of rinks, the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland boasts that it has the largest one in London. It also has plenty of kitschy carnival fun, with a Ferris wheel, carousel, circus show, old-time market stalls, and vendors selling silly hats. South of the Thames, between the London Eye and the Royal Festival Hall, a German Christmas market springs up in late November, and lasts until Christmas eve.", "\r\n\tFor those who prefer to spend winter days under a roof, London\u2019s museums, theaters, concert halls, and pubs offer a warm welcome. Many of London\u2019s best sights are free (although many request a donation), including the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain, Tate Modern, British Library, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The British Museum, larger than many villages, is a wonderful place to explore and escape the cold.", "\r\n\tIn winter, London\u2019s theater season is in high gear. The plays rival Broadway\u2019s in quality and usually beat them in price. Choose from 200 offerings \u2014 Shakespeare, musicals, comedies, thrillers, sex farces, cutting-edge fringe, revivals starring movie celebs, and more. London does it all well. I prefer big, glitzy \u2014 even bombastic \u2014 musicals over serious chamber dramas, simply because London can deliver the lights, sound, dancers, and multimedia spectacle I rarely get back home. Music-lovers seek out winter concerts at the grand, red-velvet-draped Royal Albert Hall; ask about candlelight events.", "\r\n\tPantomimes or \u201cpantos\u201d are a holiday tradition. While they have nothing to do with silent mimes \u2014 and they don\u2019t mention Christmas \u2014 these campy fairy-tale plays entertain with outrageous costumes, sets, and dance numbers. The audience is encouraged to speak up, and it doesn\u2019t take long to learn the lines (\u201cLook behind you!\u201d). Adults will laugh at the more risqu\u00e9 jokes, while kids will giggle at the slapstick.

In 1895, they made what is considered the very first motion picture \u2014 it features workers piling out of the Lumi\u00e8re factory at the end of a workday. People attended movies at first not for the plot or the action, but rather to be mesmerized by the technology that allowed them to see moving images.

I start by strolling toward the Royal Palace, which I consider Europe's third greatest palace (after Versailles, near Paris, and Sch\u00f6nbrunn in Vienna). Over the years, I've probably visited it at least 10 times \u2014 and I always learn more fascinating facts to include in my guidebook.", "\r\n\tIt's big \u2014 more than 2,000 rooms, with tons of luxurious tapestries, a king's ransom of chandeliers, priceless porcelain, and bronze decor covered in gold leaf. While these days the royal family lives in a mansion a few miles away, this place still functions as a royal palace, and is used for formal state receptions, royal weddings, and tourists' daydreams.", "\r\n\tOne highlight is the throne room, where red velvet walls, lions, and frescoes of Spanish scenes symbolize the monarchy in a Rococo riot. Another eye-stopper is the dining hall, where the king can entertain as many as 144 guests at a bowling lane\u2013size table. The ceiling fresco depicts Christopher Columbus kneeling before Ferdinand and Isabel, presenting exotic souvenirs and his New World \"friends\" to the royal couple.", "\r\n\tMy next stop is Plaza Mayor \u2014 a stately, traffic-free chunk of 17th-century Spain. Each side of the square is uniform, as if a grand palace were turned inside-out. Whether hanging out with old friends, enjoying a cup of coffee, or finding a treasure at the morning coin market, it's an appealing place where people gather.", "\r\n\tBronze reliefs under the lampposts show how upon this stage, much of Spanish history was played out. The square once hosted bullfights. It was the scene of generations of pre-Lent carnival gaiety. And during the Inquisition, many suspected heretics were tried here and punished by being strangled or burned at the stake. Thankfully, the brutality of the Inquisition is long gone.", "\r\n\tMy last stop is the Prado Museum, which holds my favorite collection of paintings anywhere. These artworks give an eye-pleasing overview of Spain's rich history, from its Golden Age through its slow fade.", "\r\n\tThe Prado is the place to enjoy the great Spanish painter Francisco de Goya. You can follow this complex man through the stages of his life \u2014 from dutiful court painter, to political rebel and scandal-maker, to the disillusioned genius of his \"black paintings.\" It's also the home of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Las Meninas, considered by some to be the world's finest painting, period. In addition to Spanish works, you'll find paintings by Italian and Flemish masters, including Hieronymus Bosch's fantastical Garden of Earthly Delights altarpiece.", "\r\n\tWith more than 3,000 canvases, including entire rooms of masterpieces by superstar painters, the Prado can be overwhelming. A $215 million expansion, completed in 2007, made this museum more visitor-friendly. A new wing holds a modern caf\u00e9, auditorium, and gift shop \u2014 freeing up exhibition space in the original building for more art. But it still gets crowded. To avoid the hordes, keep in mind that lunchtime and weekdays are generally less packed.

Despite the economic uncertainty, today's Madrid is vibrant. Even the living-statue street performers have a twinkle in their eyes. Lively Madrid has enough street-singing, bar-hopping, and people-watching vitality to give any visitor a boost. After every trip to this exciting city, the impression I take home is that of a thriving people with an enduring culture.", "\r\n\tMadrid is the hub of Spain. This modern capital \u2014 Europe's highest, at more than 2,000 feet \u2014 has a population of 3.2 million. Like its people, the city is relatively young. One hundred years ago, Madrid had only 400,000 residents \u2014 so the majority of today's Madrid is modern sprawl surrounding an intact, easy-to-navigate historic core.", "\r\n\tOnce known mainly for its museums, palaces, and tapas bars, Madrid's cityscape is changing. To support its bids to host the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, the city began some massive urban-improvement projects. Although it lost both bids (to London and then Rio de Janeiro), the construction continues as if the city had won \u2014 residents love to see all the new squares, pedestrian streets, beltway tunnels, parks, and Metro stations popping up. Even after being passed over for soccer's 2018 World Cup, optimists are eyeing future Olympics bids, giving the city an excuse to keep up the construction.", "\r\n\tMadrid's ambitious plans brought about the creation of a wonderful pedestrian street crossing the city from the Prado Museum to the Royal Palace. Strolling along Calle de las Huertas or the recently pedestrianized Calle del Arenal, you can see how the investment is turning ramshackle zones into trendy ones. By installing posts to keep cars off sidewalks, making the streets safer after dark, and restoring old buildings, Madrid is working hard to make itself more livable.", "\r\n\tJust walking these car-free streets seems to be the way the Madrile\u00f1os spend their evenings. Anyone can join the paseo. Popular routes are along Calle de las Huertas and between Puerta del Sol, the main square, and Plaza Santa Ana. Even past midnight on a hot summer night, entire families with little kids are strolling, licking ice cream, greeting their neighbors, and enjoying little beers and tapas in a series of bars. A favorite local snack is saut\u00e9ed pig's ears, and some bars specialize in just that.", "\r\n\tSpain has a reputation for partying very late, not ending until offices open in the morning. If you're people-watching early in the morning, it's actually hard to know who is finishing their day and who's just starting it. Even if you're not a party animal after midnight, make a point to be out with the happy masses, luxuriating in the cool evening air.", "\r\n\tOne reason people stay out late, especially in summer, is to escape the heat of the day. I often think people who talk about the weather and traffic have nothing else of greater interest on their minds. But here, in the lofty and over-heated interior of Spain, even people with plenty to say talk about the weather these days. The last time I was here in summer, I caught myself assessing restaurants by the quality of their air-conditioning. I saw poor locals, refugees from the heat, lying like lizards in the shade.", "\r\n\tWhen it's sizzling, Madrile\u00f1os head to Retiro Park to take a shady siesta in a 300-acre green-and-breezy escape. It's a place where you can hopscotch through a mosaic of lovers, families, skateboarders, expert bench-sitters, and pets walking their masters.", "\r\n\tOnce the private domain of royalty, this majestic park has been a favorite of Madrid's commoners since King Charles III decided to share it with his subjects in the late 18th century. In its center is a big lake (El Estanque), where you can rent a rowboat. At midday on Saturday and Sunday, the area around the lake becomes a street carnival, with jugglers, puppeteers, and lots of local color.", "\r\n\tAnother green oasis is the Royal Botanical Garden (Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico), just south of the Prado. Here you can take a lush and fragrant break in a sculpted setting, wandering among trees from around the world. It's actually more than a park \u2014 it's a museum of plants.", "\r\n\tFor great views and an ancient temple, head to the Parque de la Monta\u00f1a. In 1968, the Egyptian government was grateful for Spain's help in rescuing monuments threatened by rising waters above the Aswan Dam, so it gave its Temple de Debod to Madrid. Consequently, Madrid is the only place I can think of in Europe where you can actually wander through an intact original Egyptian temple \u2014 complete with fine carved reliefs from 200 B.C. It's in a romantic park that locals love for its memorable panoramas \u2014 especially at sunset.", "\r\n\tThroughout Europe, energetic governments are renewing green space and turning formerly car-congested wastelands into public spaces.

A 500-foot-tall granite cross marks this immense and powerful underground monument to the victims of Spain's devastating civil war.", "\r\n\tIn the late 1930s, a million Spaniards died as conservative Catholics and the military slugged it out against secular democrats, anarchists, and socialists. This war divided every village. The right-wing Fascists ultimately won, and Franco ruled Spain as its dictator until 1975.", "\r\n\tThe sorrowful piet\u00e0 draped over the entrance to the monument must have had a powerful impact on mothers who came here to remember their fallen sons. Inside, a solemn silence fills the basilica. As if measuring sorrow in distance, this 870-foot-long chamber is far longer than any church in Europe. The line of torch-like lamps adds to the somber ambience.", "\r\n\tFranco's prisoners, the enemies of the right, were put to work digging this memorial out of solid rock. It was a bitter task since Franco's grave takes center stage inside the basilica. Some Spaniards come here to honor him\u2026others come to be sure he's still dead.", "\r\n\tAlso interred here, in chapels flanking the main altar, are the remains of about 50,000 soldiers \u2014 from both sides \u2014 who lost their lives in Spain's civil war.

Nearly 2,000 years ago, Segovia was a Roman military base in need of water. So Emperor Trajan's engineers rerouted a stream into town by building a nine-mile-long aqueduct. This massive structure \u2014 ingeniously constructed with no mortar \u2014 provided water to Segovia until modern times. While locals claim it could still work today, its primary function seems to be providing a focal point for some amazing photographs.", "\r\n\tThe Plaza Mayor marks Segovia's old town center, the scene of bullfights until the 19th century.

Of course, the town centers of the East were dolled up for visitors.

A major reason why the city has been slow to rebuild is that most property owners had big mortgages on their buildings\u2026so the actual \u201cowners\u201d were the banks. With the outbreak of war, people obviously stopped making payments on evacuated and bombed-out buildings. The bank assumed ownership. And, as Yugoslavia fell apart, so did its national bank.

This strange structure is made from Bavarian freshwater shells, with Mercury (the pre-Christian god of trade and business) overseeing the action, and red wine spurting from the mermaid\u2019s breasts and dripping from Medusa\u2019s head in the courtyard. The palace and the grotto were demolished by WWII bombs. After the war, people had no money to contribute to the reconstruction \u2014 but they could gather shells.

In my guidebook, it\u2019s described like this: \u201cHeilig-Geist-St\u00fcberl is a funky, retro little hole-in-the-wall where you are sure to meet locals (the German cousins of those who go to Reno because it\u2019s cheaper than Vegas, and who consider karaoke high culture). The interior, a 1980s time warp, makes you feel like you\u2019re stepping into an alcoholic cuckoo clock.\u201d", "Georg cracks up about the last three words.

This last Oktoberfest came with extreme security \u2014 the most I saw. Why? Because Germany is in Afghanistan.\u201d", "A bit later, seeing someone walk by with a T-shirt reading, \u201cCosta Rica: no army since 1948,\u201d Georg says, \u201cI think America would be more a super power without an army. With no army at all. Think of what you could do with your money instead.\u201d I explain to Georg that you cannot seriously discuss that issue in the USA. He says, \u201cYes, I know.

I mention that Austria just went smoke-free in restaurants this month. Georg thinks they\u2019ll fight it. I marvel at how many people still smoke despite the comically blunt \u201csmoking kills\u201d warnings on cigarette packs. And he can\u2019t resist commenting on America\u2019s love affair with guns. \u201cIn European eyes, this America and private guns is something very funny. In the supermarket, kaboom, you defend yourself with a gun.\u201d He doubles over in laughter. Recovering, he admits, \u201cIn a different aspect, we are mad, too. In Germany, every man has the right to go as fast as he wants on our roads. All Europe has a speed limit except in Germany. That\u2019s our gun. Not even the Social Democrats dare to have speed limit discussion. Only the Greens do. It\u2019s guns for you, speed for us, and smoke for Austrians. And Italians\u2026they vote for Berlusconi. Berlusconi just bought a Botticelli. Like Mussolini owning a Rafael. They shouldn\u2019t let it happen.\u201d", "To Georg, having guns everywhere and the death penalty seems incongruous. He marvels, \u201cYou have the death penalty and you give people the right to have a gun. To join the EU, you can\u2019t even talk about the death penalty. It is so fundamental. The state does not kill people. That\u2019s one reason why Turkey can\u2019t get in to the EU. But we kill ourselves without guns.

I remember my first visit as a wide-eyed 18-year-old to this quintessential southern Italian city. My travel buddy and I stepped off the train into the same vast Piazza Garibaldi that 35 years later still strikes visitors as a big paved hellhole. On that first trip, a man in a white surgeons\u2019 gown approached me and said, \u201cPlease, we need blood for a dying baby.\u201d We immediately did a U-turn, stepped back into the station, and made a beeline for Greece.\n\r\n\tToday, even with its new affluence and stress on law and order, Naples remains uniquely thrilling. With more than two million people, Naples is the third-largest city in Italy. It also has almost no open spaces or parks, which makes its position as Europe\u2019s most densely populated city plenty evident. Watching the police try to enforce traffic sanity is almost comical in Italy\u2019s grittiest, most polluted, and most crime-ridden city. But Naples surprises the observant traveler with its impressive knack for living, eating, and raising children in the streets with good humor and decency. One of my favorite sightseeing experiences anywhere in Italy is simply wandering the streets here.\n\r\n\tI recently returned to Naples, where I spent an hour and took probably a hundred photos just observing the teens on motorcycles in the vertical neighborhoods of the Spaccanapoli district. Every few yards a couple of James-Dean-cool guys were leaning against lampposts while three or four girls straddling the same motorbike would cruise by as if playing Neapolitan Idol.\n\r\n\tThere\u2019s always something crazy going on in Naples. One year it was a great and stinky garbage strike. Many tourists seemed to be obsessed with it. Sure there were minibus-sized garbage mounds parked on the curb every couple of blocks. It\u2019s easy to make a big newspaper stink about it, but locals seemed to just hold their noses, knowing that someday this little piece of Naples chaos would be dealt with. I smelled nothing.\n\r\n\tOn the street I ran across the \u201cChapel of Maradona\u201d \u2014 a tiny niche on the wall dedicated to Diego Maradona, a soccer star who played for Naples in the 1980s. Locals consider soccer almost a religion, and this guy was practically a deity. You can even see a \u201chair of Diego\u201d and a teardrop from the city when he went to another team for more money.\n\r\n\tAround the corner there\u2019s an entire street lined with shops that sell tiny components of fantastic manger scenes, including figurines caricaturing local politicians and celebrities \u2014 should you want to add Bush, Clinton, or Berlusconi to your nativity set. There are also many gold and silver shops, though this is where stolen jewelry ends up. According to locals, thieves quickly sell their goods, the items are melted down immediately, and new pieces go on sale as soon as they cool.\n\r\n\tNaples has the most intact street plan of any ancient Roman city. I like to imagine this place during those times, with streetside shop fronts that closed up after dark, turning into private homes. Today, it\u2019s just one more page in a 2,000-year-old story of a city: kisses, near misses, and all kinds of meetings, beatings, and cheatings.\n\r\n\tYou name it, it occurs right on the streets today, as it has since ancient times.

Tan lines, though, can be hard to find, as Europeans are relaxed about topless sunbathing. While some stretches of the beach are public, much of it is private.

It's about $35 to rent a spot for the day, complete with towel, mattress, lounge chair, and umbrella.\u00a0", "\r\n\tBut Nice is much more than the beach and the sea. With its fine palette of museums (most of which are free), good food, and ramble-worthy old town, Nice is the enjoyable big-city highlight of any Riviera visit. The city is in the midst of reinventing its public spaces, creating green parkways and demolishing old eyesores. A modern, smooth-as-silk tramway running through the center of town makes it cheap and easy to get around.\u00a0", "\r\n\tThe old center itself is traffic-free. With its soft orange buildings and steep narrow streets, this part of town feels more Italian than French. It's not surprising, because until 1860 Nice was ruled by an Italian king.

This mixed pedigree has left Nice with a likeable blend of French superiority and Italian informality.", "\r\n\tThe plaza called Cours Saleya, a commotion of color, sights, smells, and people, has been old Nice's main market since the Middle Ages.

The Molinard family, for one, has been making perfume from Riviera flowers for a century. (You can experiment with mixing your own fragrances at their storefront museum near Nice's promenade.) Perfume makers like to say that scents are first distilled like cognac and then aged like wine. They aren't exaggerating: 660 pounds of lavender go into just one quart of pure essence.\u00a0", "\r\n\tBesides tourists, Nice's sublime light and weather has attracted artists. In the early 20th century, Henri Matisse and Marc Chagall were among the masters who came here, and the city has a museum devoted to each. The Chagall Museum is a delight, even for those who are suspicious of modern art.

Construction of this impressive Romanesque/Gothic church (with its Byzantine-style domes) started immediately after Anthony's death in 1231.

You could spend a week in Prague and a week in Paris for example. And you can have your air fare included in the package. Rick has been encouraged to expand into South America and Asia but I feel sticking to what you know best is a great recipe for business success. So if Rick Steves were to buy or work a deal with Untour, he could cover both ends of the European travel spectrum   by serving his conventional clients plus those that want to stay in one or two different locations for seven nights at a time (like Nafplio, Greece) and immerse themselves in the local culture.

After the Revolution, business boomed when entire libraries were liberated from nobles or clergymen and wound up for sale cheap on the banks of the Seine.

With little overhead, prices are usually cheaper than in most shops. Bouquinistes must be open at least four days a week, or they lose their spot. Wednesdays are best (when school is out), and warm, dry days are golden (notice that every item is wrapped in protective plastic).

For some people, it can be overwhelming to try to make sense of the vast range of French wines, particularly when faced with a no-nonsense winemaker or sommelier.", "\r\n\tI\u2019m no wine expert and would never claim to be, but I\u2019ve learned a lot from Olivier Magny, a young Parisian sommelier who gathers tourists for wine-tastings in a royal cellar a block from the Louvre. The last time I was there, Olivier gave us a wonderful commentary. Here\u2019s what I gleaned from his presentation:", "\r\n\tWhite wine should be clear...if not, it\u2019s Spanish.", "\r\n\tAcidity is like salt. It gives wine character. \u201cLegs,\u201d a.k.a. \u201ctears,\u201d indicates how much sugar is in the wine. Dry wine has fewer legs; sweet wine has more and faster-running legs.", "\r\n\tWhen you sip a little wine and then suck air in, it exaggerates the character. You\u2019re not making it better, but bringing out its flavors, so that it\u2019s easier to identify the characteristics of that particular wine. Olivier feels that Americans need to break out of their four favorite words to describe the taste of wine: \u201cdry, sweet, fruity, oaky.\u201d", "\r\n\tThe Champagne region defended its name and therefore has a strong image today. The Chablis region did not, so winegrowers outside of France used the name and made it cheaply. Today the real Chablis is better than its reputation.", "\nTerroir (pronounced \u201ctehr-wah\u201d) is a uniquely French concept. The French don\u2019t call a wine by the grape\u2019s name. Two wines can be made of the same grape, but be of very different character because of their terroir. A real Chablis made from the Chardonnay grape is better than Chardonnays made elsewhere because of its terroir. Terroir is \u201csomewhere-ness,\u201d a combination of the macro- and microclimate, soil, geology, and culture (the accumulated experience of the people and their craft).", "\r\n\tGrapevines are creepers, with roots going through the topsoil and into the geology deep down. The roots are commonly 150 feet long and deep. While topsoil can be influenced by the vintner, the deep geology cannot; and this gives the wine a distinct character. The French do not allow irrigation, thus forcing the grapes to search deep for water.", "\r\n\tThere are two basic kinds of wine in this world: that of big growers and that of little growers. Big business works better for wine in places like Argentina and Australia (where three companies dominate the wine industry). Most French wine is still made by thousands of small, independent, and passionate vintners.", "\r\n\tThe French are not enthusiastic about the oaky taste of American wine. A French vintner went to a wine conference in California, where some wineries use barrels made from American oak rather than French oak. When pressed to comment on California wines, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t like oak shaping my wine. When I drink Californian wine, I feel like I\u2019m kissing Pinocchio.\u201d (Actually, he had a more graphic way of describing it.) Without the focus on oak-barrel aging, and because of the business environment that encourages small outfits, Olivier says French wine is lighter and more diverse.", "\r\n\tBecause of global climate change, wine in general is sweeter these days. A grape can\u2019t be harvested properly until it\u2019s both sweet enough and the tannins are right. This used to happen at about the same time. But lately the grapes are sweet many days before the tannin level is ready. Consequently, when the tannins are right and the grapes can be harvested, they are sweeter than is optimal. Before, the average wine was 11 percent alcohol; now it\u2019s 13 percent.", "\r\n\tEveryone wants Bordeaux Grand Cru, and that demand drives up the price. That\u2019s why Bordeaux, while very good, is overpriced. Burgundy makes only about 3 percent of all French wine. Because of its reputation and the demand, it is overpriced as well.", "\r\n\tBack when rooms were cooler, the idea that red wine is best drunk at room temperature was established. But room temperature is higher now than it used to be. Consequently, many restaurants serve their reds too warm. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to ask for it to be chilled; five or 10 minutes in the fridge, and it\u2019ll be just right.", "\r\n\tGenerally, in France you\u2019ll get light wines in the north, and big, full-bodied wines in the south where it\u2019s sunnier. A big name (e.g., Bordeaux, Burgundy) means a big price. A small name (e.g., Languedoc, Sud-Ouest) means potentially better value. Languedoc can be a great value for a big Syrah. A high-end Languedoc costs less than a low-end Bordeaux. Of the thousand different grapes that make good wine, 10 are famous.", "\r\n\tOlivier\u2019s best tip about French wine came at the end: Don\u2019t be intimidated \u2014 break out and experiment.

After that, within five years, France had conquered most of Europe, and Napoleon declared himself emperor of it all.", "\r\n\tAs the head of France's grand million-man army, he blitzed Europe. His personal charisma on the battlefield was said to be worth 10,000 additional men. But it all came to an end on farmland 15 miles south of Brussels. Two centuries later, the Belgians spiffed up the Waterloo battlefield for the bicentennial, but to get a better feel for Napoleon, head to Paris.", "\r\n\tSouth of the city, the Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau has more Napoleon connections than any other palace in France, featuring both his personal apartments and an adjacent museum. Napoleon's throne room is the only one in France with its original furniture.

There's also a tent-like room dedicated to Napoleon at war, with his small-but-iconic battle coat and hat, a field cot, and first-class camp gear.", "\r\n\tGrand paintings portray the emperor and his first wife, Josephine, after their coronation. Napoleon aspired to create his own family dynasty, but Josephine was too old to have children. To turn his Corsican blood blue, he divorced Josephine and married a Habsburg.

This revolutionary hero came out of a movement that killed off the Old Regime \u2014 only to create a new Old Regime.", "\r\n\tThere's no better symbol of Napoleon's oversized ego than Paris' Arc de Triomphe. Patterned after the ceremonial arches of ancient Roman conquerors (but more than twice the size), it celebrates Napoleon as emperor of a \"New Rome.\" On the arch's massive left pillar, a relief sculpture shows a toga-clad Napoleon posing confidently, while an awestruck Paris \u2014 crowned by her city walls \u2014 kneels at his imperial feet. Napoleon died before the Arc's completion, but it was finished in time for his 1840 funeral procession to pass underneath, carrying his remains (19 years dead) from exile to Paris.", "\r\n\tElsewhere in Paris, the complex of Les Invalides \u2014 a former veterans' hospital built by Louis XIV \u2014 has various French military collections, collectively called the Army Museum. Here, in addition to galleries on World War I and World War II, you'll see plenty of Napoleon memorabilia: a bed with mosquito netting, a director's chair, his overcoat and pistols, and a table that you can imagine his generals hunched over as they made battle plans. Napoleon's beloved Arabian horse \u2014 Le Vizir \u2014 weathered many a campaign with Napoleon, grew old with him in exile, and now stands stuffed and proud. Not everything here is old and stuffy \u2014 the museum also features high-tech exhibits such as a projection screen that maps the course of the Battle of Waterloo.", "\r\n\tAt the other end of the complex, Napoleon's tomb rests beneath a dome that glitters with 26 pounds of thinly pounded gold leaf. Enter the church, gaze up at the dome, then lean over the railing and bow to the emperor lying inside the scrolled, red porphyry tomb. If you've ever considered being absolute dictator of a united Europe, come here first. Hitler did, but still went out and made the same mistakes as Napoleon. (Hint: Don't invade Russia.)", "\r\n\tAfter Waterloo, Napoleon was sent into exile on the island of St. Helena. Once the most powerful man in the world, he spent his final years as a lonely outcast suffering from ulcers, dressed in his nightcap and slippers, and playing chess, not war.", "\r\n\tWhile you're visiting these places, it's instructive to ponder these symbols of war, empire, and revolution. Why are today's French so hell-bent on defending their civil liberties? Perhaps it has to do with their heritage of struggling so long and hard to overcome the stubborn abuse of power to earn their freedom. When you travel to Paris, it's clear: Napoleon has left today's visitors with some amazing and thought-provoking sights.", "\r\n\tI have a ritual when in Paris. I ask my taxi-driver to take me around the Arc de Triomphe two times. My cabbie plunges into the grand traffic circle where a dozen boulevards converge on this mightiest of triumphal arches.

The 12 arterials that radiate from the Arc de Triomphe were part of his master plan: the creation of a series of major boulevards, intersecting at diagonals with monuments as centerpieces (such as the Arc de Triomphe). As we zip around the circle, it\u2019s obvious that Haussmann\u2019s plan did not anticipate the automobile.", "\r\n\tMy cabbie explains to me, \u201cIf there is an accident here, each driver is considered equally at fault. This is the only place in Paris where the accidents are not judged. No matter what the circumstances, insurance companies split the costs fifty-fifty. In Paris, a good driver gets only scratches, not dents.\u201d", "\r\n\tThe commotion of cars fights to get to the arch at the center as if to pay homage to the national spirit of France. Cars entering the circle have the right-of-way; those in the circle must yield. Parisian drivers navigate the circle like a comet circling the sun \u2014 making a parabola. It\u2019s a game of fender-bender chicken.

As marble Lady Liberties scramble up the arch Napoleon ordered built, heroically thrusting their swords and shrieking at the traffic, all of Paris seems drawn into this whirlpool.", "\r\n\tThe Arc de Triomphe affords a great Paris view, but only to those who earn it by climbing its 284 steps. Begun in 1806, the arch was intended to honor Napoleon\u2019s soldiers, who, in spite of being vastly outnumbered by the Austrians, scored a remarkable victory at the battle of Austerlitz. Napoleon died long before the arch was completed. But it was finished in time for his posthumous homecoming in 1840. Nineteen years after he died in exile on St. Helena, his remains were carried in a grand parade underneath his grand arch.", "\r\n\tThe Arc de Triomphe is dedicated to the glory of all French armies. Like its Roman ancestors, this arch has served as a parade gateway for triumphal armies (French or foe) and the stage for important ceremonies. From 1940 to 1944, a large swastika flew from here as Nazis goose-stepped daily down the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Allied troops marched triumphantly under this arch in August 1944.", "\r\n\tStanding under the arch, you\u2019re surrounded by names of French victories since the Revolution, the names of great French generals (underlined if they died in battle), and by France\u2019s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Its flame \u2014 flickering silently in the eye of this urban storm \u2014 seems to invite to savor this grandiose monument to French nationalism. On my last visit, a French WWII vet, still wearing his ribbons, explained that every day at 6:30 p.m. since just after World War I, the flame is rekindled and new flowers set in place.", "\r\n\tClimbing to the top of the arch is like summiting Paris. From this historic perch you look down along the huge axis that shoots like an arrow all the way from the Louvre, up the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, through the arch, then straight down Avenue de la Grande-Arm\u00e9e to a forest of distant skyscrapers around an even bigger modern arch in suburban La D\u00e9fense.", "\r\n\tThe skyscrapers in the suburbs contrast sharply with the uniformly low-slung buildings downtown. The beauty of Paris \u2014 basically a flat basin with a river running through it \u2014 is man-made. The key to this beauty is the harmonious relationship between the width of its grand boulevards and the height and design of the buildings. This elegant skyline is broken only by venerable historic domes, the Eiffel Tower \u2014 and the rude and lonely Montparnasse Tower, which stands like the box the Eiffel Tower came in. The appearance of this black, blocky tower served as a wake-up call in the early 1970s to preserve the historic skyline of downtown Paris.", "\r\n\tLooking down from the arch, you get a bird\u2019s-eye view of the crazy traffic you survived to get here.

When I report on it, I routinely get fellow Americans angry at me for bringing home news of a land where the desired alternative to big bad government is not little good government but big good government. I\u2019m not necessarily in favor of this (and I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to run my business over here). But I don\u2019t find it offensive either. In fact, I\u2019m challenged by it. Here are a few observations gleaned from conversations I just had here in Oslo. (In response to a comment below: Norway is resource rich\u2013lots of oil money. But without oil money, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland have essentially the same priorities and somehow manage.) Norwegians look forward to November. It\u2019s \u201chalf tax month\u201d as the government wants people to have some extra money for the upcoming holidays. With their current booming economies coupled with tax incentives for new babies, the Nordic countries are experiencing a baby boom. Paternity leave is very generous here. Scandinavian families get nine months leave at 80 percent pay which the mom or dad can split as they like. On top of this, men are required\u2013use it or lose it\u2013to take a paid month of paternity leave when their baby arrives.", "While there are more babies around here, there\u2019s less smoke.

It was so old and brown that it still smelled of tobacco\u2026but there hasn\u2019t been a smoker in there for months. With the strict no smoking rules (a bar can lose its license if it allows smoking inside), restaurants are now routinely equipped with blankets so smokers can eat outside\u2013even in the cold season.

Restaurants and bars are too expensive for the average Norwegian to use carelessly. Young Norwegians love their alcohol. But they b.y.o.b.

I\u2019m not talking just mixed saunas. Parents let their kids run naked in city parks and fountains. It\u2019s really no big deal. Norway has co-ed PE classes with boys and girls showering together from the first grade. If you ever end up in a Norwegian hospital and need an x-ray, I hope you\u2019re not modest.

Its interior dates from about 1900, when the heir of the Habsburg throne, Franz Ferdinand, moved in. Money was no object as Ferdinand turned his castle into a palace with all the latest comforts: As one of the first castles in Europe to have an elevator\u2026a shower with hot and cold running water\u2026and even a new-fangled flush toilet, Konopi\u0161t\u011b shows \"modern\" living around the year 1900.", "\r\n\tThe archduke had lots of time on his hands because his uncle, Emperor Franz Josef held onto power from 1848 \u2014 and all the way until 1916. While he waited, Ferdinand amassed one of the best collections of weaponry in the world. For Ferdinand, guns were more than showpieces. Obsessed with hunting, he traveled around the world, shooting at anything with four legs: deer, bear, tigers, elephants, and this Polish buffalo. He actually recorded over 200,000 kills in his log. Keep in mind that royal hunting was a kind of massacre game with his aides sweeping doomed animals into the archduke's eager sights. Over 4,000 trophies decorate the walls and halls of his castle.", "\r\n\tFranz Ferdinand did more than his share of shooting.

Children made dolls of their friends \"in transport\" \u2014 as if relocating was just the start of the next stage of their lives.

The town sits upon what was Europe's largest silver mine. Today, visitors play miner and climb down 200 yards below the town to explore the medieval mine shafts that honeycombed the ground under Kutna Hora.

Fourteenth-century plagues and 15th-century wars provided all the raw material necessary for the creepily creative monks who made these designs. Those who first placed these bones 400 years ago wanted viewers to remember that the earthly church is a community of both the living and the dead, a countless multitude that will one day stand before God.

Back in the day, the palace\u2019s large hall was filled with market stalls, giving nobles a chance to shop without actually going into town. The space was even big enough for jousts, with a staircase that was designed to let a mounted soldier gallop in.

It\u2019s got a century\u2019s worth of teddy bears, some 19th-century model train sets, old Christmas decor, and an incredible Barbie collection, complete with social commentary. Looking at the buxom first-edition Barbie, I see why these sirens of capitalist sirens of material discontent and objectifiers of women\u2019s bodies weren\u2019t allowed here until 1989.", "\r\n\tJust across the castle lane from Barbie is Lobkowicz Palace, which displays the private collection of a prominent Czech noble family, including paintings, ceramics, and musical scores.

As William put it, \u201cWe\u2019re just real people who own lots of big palaces.\u201d As if to prove a point, a cute schoolboy popped in on our conversation.

Known in Roman times as Classe, the city was an imperial port for the large naval fleet. Briefly a capital of eastern Rome during its fall, Ravenna was taken by the barbarians. Then, in A.D. 540, the Byzantine emperor Justinian turned Ravenna into the westernmost pillar of the Byzantine Empire.

But to see its brilliant mosaics still conveying the intended feeling that \"this peace and stability was brought to you by your emperor and by God\" is rare indeed. Study the scenes of apostles, the lamb on the twinkly ceiling, the beardless Christ astride a blue earth, and Emperor Justinian and his wife Theodora (an aggressive Constantinople showgirl who used all her charms to gain power with \u2014 and even over \u2014 her emperor husband) in their lavish court. San Vitale can be seen as the last of the ancient Roman art and the first of the Christian era. This church was the prototype for Constantinople's Hagia Sophia built 10 years later, and it inspired Charlemagne to build the first great church in northern Europe in his capital of Aix-la-Chapelle, now present-day Aachen.", "\r\n\tThe Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, just across the courtyard from the basilica, is the humble-looking little mausoleum with the oldest \u2014 and to many, the best \u2014 mosaics in Ravenna.

Rockefeller.\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n\tFlying buttresses soar from the sides of the church. These massive \u201cbeams\u201d are critical to supporting this structure. The pointed arches inside the church push the weight of the roof outward, rather than downward. The \u201cflying\u201d buttresses support the roof by pushing back inward, creating a delicate balance between the two forces. Gothic architects learned by trial and error \u2014 many church roofs caved in as they tested their theories and strove to build ever higher.\n\r\n\tContemplate the lives of the people who erected this huge building, starting in 1211.

The Vespa (motor scooter) is their symbol; haircuts and fashion are follow-the-leader.", "\r\n\tIn a more genteel small town, the passeggiata comes with sweet whispers of \"bella\" and \"bello\" (\"pretty\" and \"handsome\") as the boys and girls eye each other. But in Rome, the admiration is more strongly oriented toward consumption \u2014 they say \"buona\" and \"buono,\" meaning \"good\" (terms used to describe food).

As the pope circulates, the peacocks of the security world \u2014 the fancy-garbed Vatican guard, with their flamboyant helmets and medieval pikes shining under heavenly sunrays \u2014 are on high alert. Their darting eyes and walkie-talkie earpieces show they're there for more than ritual and decoration.", "\r\n\tAfterward, the crowd pours like sand out of a spiritual hourglass from the basilica into St. Peter's Square. There, I join an even larger crowd that just \"attended\" the Mass on huge rock-concert-type video screens.

Suddenly, the famous window opens, the red banner flops down, and the pope appears.", "\r\n\tAfter the pope finishes his short greeting, the crowd dissipates into Rome. Going with the human flow, I cross the Ponte Sant'Angelo, a bridge as old as the papacy.

Jews here have a uniquely Roman style of worship and even preserve remnants of their own Judaic-Roman dialect. That's because, unlike most of the world's Jewish people, Roman Jews are neither Sephardic (descended from Spain) nor Ashkenazi (descended from Eastern Europe). Italy's Jews came directly from the Holy Land before the Diaspora, first arriving in Rome in the second century B.C. as esteemed envoys (hoping to establish business ties) and then, after Rome invaded Judaea in the first century A.D., as POWs sold into slavery. These first Jews lived, like other foreigners, outside the city \u2014 across the river, in Trastevere.", "\r\n\tThe Romans favored the Jews because they were well-networked throughout the empire, they didn't push their religion on others, and most important, they paid their taxes. But with the fall of the Roman Empire, the status of Jews declined. As Christianity enveloped Rome, the state denied Jews their full rights as citizens, and once the pope became literally the king of Rome, the Church enforced laws that limited the spread of the Jewish faith (such as no proselytizing, no new synagogues, no intermarriage). The severity of these laws varied from pope to pope. Through most of the Middle Ages, the standing of Rome's Jews fluctuated, but for the most part they prospered and were often held in high regard as physicians, businessmen, and confidants of popes. The community in Trastevere was even allowed to spill across to the opposite bank of the Tiber.", "\r\n\tThen, in 1492, Spain expelled its Jews, with similar removals following in other European countries. Rome's Jewish population doubled, swelling with refugees. By the 1500s, the Catholic Counter-Reformation \u2014 begun to combat rising Protestantism \u2014 turned its attention to anything deemed a \"heresy\" or simply not Catholic, including Judaism. In 1555, Pope Paul IV forcibly moved all of Rome's Jews into the undesirable flood zone inside a bend of the Tiber River, creating a ghetto of some 4,000 Jews packed into a miserable seven acres of mucky land. There they lived \u2014 in cramped conditions, behind a wall, with a curfew \u2014 for three centuries. They could go out by day, but had to return before the gates were locked at night. Jews were forced to wear yellow scarves and caps, and were prohibited from owning property or holding good jobs. During Carnevale (Mardi Gras), they were forced to parade down Via del Corso while Christians lined the streets and shouted insults. Through this long stretch of oppression, the synagogue was the only place Jews could feel respected and dignified. It's no wonder such loving attention was given to the Jewish tools of worship.", "\r\n\tRome's Jews enjoyed a little boost in freedom when Napoleon occupied the city (1805\u20131814) and after the ghetto walls were torn down in 1848. But it was only after Italian unification in 1870 \u2014 when a secular government replaced the religious rule of the Vatican \u2014 that the ghetto's inhabitants were granted full rights and citizenship. When Rome became the country's capital, the city \u2014 ashamed of its shoddy Jewish quarter \u2014 destroyed the old ghetto and modernized the district, giving it the street plan we see today.", "\r\n\tThen came the rise of fascism. Even though Mussolini wasn't rabidly anti-Semitic, he instituted a slew of anti-Jewish laws as he allied himself more strongly with Hitler. When Mussolini was deposed and the Nazis occupied Rome late in the war, the ghetto community was suddenly in even greater danger. Of the 13,000 ghetto dwellers, 2,000 were sent off to concentration camps. Only a handful came back.", "\r\n\tA measure of healing and reconciliation came with Pope John Paul II, who took a special interest in fostering relations with the Jewish community. It was John Paul II who finally acknowledged that the Church should have intervened more forcefully to defend the Jews during the Holocaust.

He's believed to have miraculous healing powers, and it's said that the Bambino's lips turn red if a prayer is about to be answered and pale if there is no hope. Children especially love the Bambino, writing him letters and reciting poems to him on Christmas Day. The Bambino figure is usually kept in a glass case in a chapel, but at the stroke of midnight on Christmas Eve, he's presented to the church's eager and expectant congregation.", "\r\n\tThe Vatican's Nativity scene has always been the premier decoration on St. Peter's Square. But Pope John Paul II, who grew up in Poland and became the first non-Italian pope in a very long time, missed having a Christmas tree. So, in 1982, he added a lighted evergreen to the celebrations, standing tall near the central obelisk. Each year on Christmas Eve, the pope celebrates midnight Mass at St. Peter's Basilica.

On the eve of Epiphany, the Befana flies over the rooftops of Rome on her broom and brings gifts to the good children or coal for the bad ones \u2014 although, these days the \"coal\" is a crunchy black confection sold at street-corner carts. According to Francesca, the children of Rome leave La Befana a snack of some soft ricotta cheese since she has hardly any teeth.", "\r\n\tSome Roman parents threaten naughty kids with, \"Lo dico alla Befana!\" (I'll tell the Befana!), or the ever-popular, \"Viene la Befana e ti porta via!\" (The Befana will come and take you away!), which is very bad news indeed, because Befana has an ogre of a husband who devours children. According to legend, the three Wise Men stopped to ask Befana for directions to Bethlehem and the Christ child, but she was too busy to help. As time passed, Befana kept thinking about the strange visitors and their quest. With a sack filled with bread, she set out to find baby Jesus, too. Whenever she saw a baby boy, she gave him a piece of bread, hoping he might be the Christ child. Befana still wanders through Italy each Christmas season looking for the baby and leaving goodies for the children.

There's big bread (panettone), golden bread (pandoro), strong bread (panforte), and sweet bread (pandolce).

Later, around 400 B.C., Rome conquered Ostia and made it a naval base, complete with a fort. By A.D. 150, when Rome controlled all the Mediterranean, Ostia served as its busy commercial port.", "\r\n\tWith the fall of Rome, the port was abandoned. Over time the harbor silted up.

Most of the statues are second- and third-century A.D. Roman pieces inspired by rare and famous Greek originals. The portrait busts are of real people \u2014 the kind you'd sit next to in the baths (or at the famous one-room public toilets with multiple seats). Roman religion revered the man of the house (and his father and grandfather). As statues of daddy and grandpa were common in the corner of any proper house, many survive today.", "\r\n\tSurviving frescos, while scant and humble, give a feeling for how living quarters may have been \"wallpapered.\" What is perhaps the museum's most interesting room features statuary from religions of foreign lands. Being a port town, Ostia accommodated people (and their worship needs) from all over the known world.", "\r\n\tThese days, you can stroll among the ruins and trace the grid standard for Roman military towns: a rectangular fort with east, west, north, and south gates and two main roads converging on the Forum. Walking along the main drag, Decumanus Maximus, you can identify buildings from the Republic (centuries before Christ) and the Empire (centuries after Christ) by their level. Over the centuries, Ostia's ground level rose, and the road was elevated. Anything you walk down into is B.C.", "\r\n\tOn the main drag is the vast theater (teatro). One of the oldest brick theaters anywhere, it's still used for concerts today. The three rows of marble steps near the orchestra used to be for big shots.", "\r\n\tJust in front of the theater is the grand Square of the Guilds, the former bustling center of Rome's import/export industry, with more than 60 offices of ship-owners and traders. Along the sidewalk, second-century A.D. mosaics advertise the services offered by the various shops \u2014 a lighthouse symbolizes the port of Ostia and an elephant marks the office of traders from Africa. It's fun to walk the entire square guessing from the ancient signs what was once for sale behind each store front.", "\r\n\tThe Forum Baths, a huge, government-subsidized complex, were the city's social nerve center. Fine marble steps \u2014 great for lounging \u2014 led to the pools. People used olive oil rather than soap to wash, so the water needed to be periodically skimmed by servants. From the viewpoint overlooking the Baths of Neptune you can see a fine mosaic of Neptune riding four horses through roller-coaster waves.", "\r\n\tAlong Via Casa di Diana is the House of Diana, a great example of insulae (multi-storied tenement complexes where the lower middle-class lived) and an inn called the Insula of the Thermopolium. If you belly up to this tavern's bar you'll see a small sink, shelves once used to display food and drinks for sale, and scant remains of wall paintings.", "\r\n\tA meander down Ostia's back lanes is a veritable archaeological scavenger hunt. Look for hidden bits of fresco, preserved mosaic flooring, and millstones for grinding grain back when business was booming.", "\r\n\tThe key to enjoying sights from ancient Rome is to resurrect all that rubble in your mind. A quick trip out to Rome's ancient port helps do just that, making it more likely that your hours climbing through the wonders of ancient Rome will give you goose bumps rather than heatstroke.", "\r\n\tThe Appian Way \u2014 Rome's gateway to the East \u2014 was Europe's first super highway and the wonder of its day. Built in 312 B.C., it connected Rome with Capua (near Naples), running in a straight line for much of the way. Eventually it stretched 400 miles to Brindisi, from where Roman ships sailed to Greece and Egypt.", "\r\n\tWhile our modern roads seem to sprout potholes right after they're built, sections of this marvel of Roman engineering still exist. When I visit Rome, I get a thrill walking on the same stones as Julius Caesar or St. Peter. Huge basalt paving blocks form the sturdy base of this roadway. In its heyday, a central strip accommodated animal-powered vehicles, and elevated sidewalks served pedestrians.", "\r\n\tFortunately, about the first 10 miles of the Appian Way is preserved as a regional park (Parco dell'Appia Antica). In addition to the roadway, there are ruined Roman monuments, two major Christian catacombs, and a church marking the spot where Peter had a vision of Jesus.", "\r\n\tGetting here from the center of Rome is easy; it's a short Metro ride and then a quick bus trip. It's best to come on a Sunday or holiday, when the whole park is closed to car traffic, and it becomes Rome's biggest pedestrian zone. You can rent bicycles \u2014 and enjoy a meal \u2014 at a nearby caf\u00e9.", "\r\n\tAs you stroll or bike along the road, you'll see tombs of ancient big shots that line the way like billboards. While pagans didn't enjoy the promise of salvation, those who could afford it purchased a kind of immortality by building themselves big and glitzy memorials. One of the best preserved is the Tomb of Cecilia Metella, built for the daughter-in-law of Rome's richest man. It's a massive cylindrical tomb situated on the crest of a hill. While it dates from the first century B.C., we still remember her today...so apparently the investment paid off.", "\r\n\tBut of course, early Christians didn't have that kind of money. So they buried their dead in mass underground necropoli \u2014 catacombs \u2014 dug under the property of the few fellow Christians who owned land. These catacombs are scattered all around Rome just outside its ancient walls, including two inside this park.", "\r\n\tThe tomb-lined tunnels of the catacombs stretch for miles and are many layers deep. Many of the first Christians buried here were later recognized as martyrs and saints. Others carved out niches nearby to bury their loved ones close to these early Christian heroes. While the bones are long gone, symbolic carvings decorate the walls: the fish stood for Jesus, the anchor was a camouflaged cross, and the phoenix with a halo symbolized the resurrection.", "\r\n\tBy the Middle Ages, these catacombs were abandoned and forgotten. Centuries later they were rediscovered. Romantic-era tourists on the Grand Tour visited them by candlelight, and legends grew about Christians hiding out to escape persecution. But the catacombs were not hideouts. They were simply low-budget underground cemeteries. The Appian Way has two major Christian catacombs, each offering visitors a half-hour underground tour to see the niches where early Christians were buried. The Catacombs of San Sebastiano also has a historic fourth-century basilica with holy relics, while the larger Catacombs of San Callisto is the burial site for several early popes.", "\r\n\tOn your way back to the city center, stop by the Domine Quo Vadis Church. This tiny ninth-century church (redone in the 17th century) was built on the spot where Peter, while fleeing the city to escape Nero's persecution, saw a vision of Christ. Peter asked Jesus, \"Lord, where are you going?\" (\"Domine quo vadis?\" in Latin), to which Christ replied, \"I am going to Rome to be crucified again.\" This miraculous sign gave Peter faith and courage, causing him to return to Rome.", "\r\n\tInside the nave of the church, you can stumble over the stone marked with the supposed footprints of Jesus. You'll see a fresco of Peter with keys on the left wall and one of Jesus on the right. A bust depicts Nobel Prize\u2013winning Polish author Henryk Sienkiewicz, who wrote a historical novel that was the basis for the 1951 Hollywood movie Quo Vadis.", "\r\n\tThe wonder of its day, the Appian Way was called the \"Queen of Roads.\" Twenty-nine such highways fanned out from Rome, but this one was the first and remains a legend. For a time-warp road trip that will take you back 2,000 years, hit the highway.", "As I was dining al fresco in Rome, just off Campo de\u2019 Fiori, a helicopter droned overhead.

This assumes you\u2019re finding a small and honest place with an ethic of serving a good value\u2026rather than ripping off the tourist. That\u2019s the challenge for the savvy traveler (and guidebook researcher). With $90 to spend for three meals, I\u2019d rather have one $50 blowout and two $20 dinners than three $30 dinners.

Trying \u2014 and generally failing \u2014 to turn down the chef\u2019s favorite dessert at 11 p.m., I realize why breakfast is such a small affair for many Europeans.

Over the centuries, the university\u2019s poorer students earned money to fund their education by singing in Salamanca\u2019s streets: a tradition called \u201ctuna music.\u201d The name tuna, which has nothing to do with fish, refers to a vagabond student lifesyle and later was applied to the music these students sing. This 15th- to 18th-century tradition survives today as groups of students, dressed in the traditional black capes and leggings, sing and play mandolins and guitars, serenading the public in the bars on and around the Plaza Mayor. While they make their serious money performing for weddings on weekends, you\u2019re likely to see them out singing for tips on summer week nights.", "\r\n\tFor a fun meal, do the tapa tango.

Marionette shows are a Salzburg tradition (think of the \"Lonely Goatherd\" scene in The Sound of Music). Of all the musical shows in Salzburg that I recommend, this was one I'd never actually experienced before, and the performance (with handy superscripts in English) was spellbinding.

But a close look at the surviving facade of the Roman palace fronting its harbor reveals its ancient roots. In the fourth century A.D., when the Roman emperor Diocletian retired, he built a vast residence for his golden years here in his native Dalmatia. When Rome fell, the palace was abandoned. Eventually, a medieval town sprouted from its abandoned shell. And, to this day, the maze of narrow alleys \u2014 literally Diocletian's hallways at one point in time \u2014 makes up the core of Split. Today's residents are actually living in a Roman emperor's palace.", "\r\n\tBack in its heyday, the harborfront was Diocletian's back door. There was no embankment in front of the palace, so the water came right up to the door \u2014 sort of an emergency exit by boat. Just inside this gate, visitors can explore a labyrinth of cellars that once supported the palace. Rediscovered only in the last century, the cellars enabled archaeologists to derive the floor plan of some of the palace's long-gone upper sections.", "\r\n\tFrom the cellars, a grand underground hallway, now used as a shopping arcade, leads outside to the Peristyle (Split's main square) and Diocletian's vestibule, the dramatically domed entryway to the emperor's private rooms. These days, this grand space is often home to an all-male band of a cappella singers performing klapa \u2014 the quintessential Dalmatian folk music. These songs of seafaring life, of loves lost and loves found, stir the souls of Croatians and visitors alike.", "\r\n\tOverlooking the Peristyle, Diocletian's mausoleum once dominated the center of the palace complex. Much of the original Roman building survives, including the impressive dome, columns and capitals, and fine carved reliefs. Diocletian was notorious for persecuting Christians. But a thousand years ago, his mausoleum was converted into the Cathedral of St. Dominus. And so, ironically, what Diocletian built to glorify his memory is used instead to remember his victims.", "\r\n\tA few steps away is a temple dedicated to Jupiter. Roman emperors often made themselves a god. Diocletian was Jovius, son of the top god, Jupiter. People kissed his robe; he was like a deity on earth. About the time the mausoleum became a cathedral, the temple was converted into a baptistery, housing a huge 12th-century baptismal font large enough to immerse someone (as was the tradition in those days).", "\r\n\tJust outside the Old Town is a museum dedicated to Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, Croatia's answer to Rodin.

The sculpture Job \u2014 howling with an agony verging on insanity \u2014 was carved by the artist in exile, as his country was turned upside-down by World War II.

Mateju\u0161ka has long been Split's working fishermen's harbor. While the area has received a facelift, it still retains its striped-collar character. The enclosed harbor area is filled with working fishing boats and colorful dinghies that bob in unison.

You never know where the sleepy lanes of Djurg\u00e5rden will take you. As if hiding out from the intensity of the city, Rosendals Garden Caf\u00e9 crowns the summit of the island. You can get a picnic treat at the bakery or eat in the greenhouse. I like to sip a coffee in their delightful orchard in the flower garden, where locals come to pick a bouquet and pay by the weight. The caf\u00e9 proudly serves its own produce...its garden fertilized by horse dung from the neighboring Skansen folk museum. Rolling down the garden-like lane past Rosendals Slott, the summer get-away mini-palace of a 19th-century king, I pass a giant 9-ton porphyry vase in a backyard and marvel at how, on a bike, you see things that those on tour buses never would.", "\r\n\tStockholm offers many biking opportunities.

Stockholm's program offers us the best of both worlds: The city is great for biking, and the system is straightforward for travelers to use.", "\r\n\tFor around $25, you can purchase a City Bike card at the tourist information office, transportation info centers, or at many hotels and hostels.

You can do this over and over for three days.", "\r\n\tSome travelers are surprised when I tell them to consider biking in Europe. I explain that it gets you close to the ground and close to the people.

The ship was top-heavy, with an extra row of cannons tacked on above and a lack of ballast below. A breeze caught the sails and blew it over. The ship spent more than 300 years at the bottom of Stockholm's harbor. In 1961, with the help of steel cables and huge inflatable pontoons, the Vasa rose again from the deep.

The performance is fresh and spirited because the soldiers are visiting Stockholm just like you \u2014 and it's a chance for young soldiers from all over Sweden in every branch of the service to show their stuff in the big city. Generally, after the barking and goose-stepping formalities, the band shows off for an impressive 40-minute concert.

Twentieth-century industry worsened things by pumping out massive amounts of groundwater from the aquifer beneath the lagoon for nearly 50 years before the government stopped the practice in the 1970s. In the last century, Venice has sunk by about nine inches.", "\r\n\tMeanwhile, the waters around Venice are rising, a phenomenon that's especially apparent in winter. The highest so far was in November 1966, when a huge storm (the same one that famously flooded Florence) raised Venice's water level to more than six feet above the norm. The notorious acqua alta happens when an unusually high tide combines with strong sirocco winds and a storm. Although tides are minuscule in the Mediterranean, the narrow, shallow Adriatic Sea has about a three-foot tidal range. When a storm \u2014 an area of low pressure \u2014 travels over a body of water, it pulls the surface of the water up into a dome. As strong sirocco winds from Africa blow storms north up the Adriatic, they push this high water ahead of the front, causing a surging storm tide. Add to that the worldwide sea-level rise that's resulted from recent climate change (melting ice caps, thermal expansion of the water, more frequent and more powerful storms) and it makes a high sea that much higher.", "\r\n\tIf the acqua alta appears during your visit, you'll see the first puddles in the center of paved squares, pooling around the limestone grates at the square's lowest point. These grates cover cisterns that long held Venice's only source of drinking water. That's right: Surrounded by the lagoon and beset by constant flooding, this city had no natural source of fresh water. For centuries, residents carried water from the mainland with much effort and risk. In the ninth century, they devised a way to collect rainwater by using paved, cleverly sloped squares as catchment systems, with limestone filters covering underground clay tubs.", "\r\n\tVenice's population grew markedly once citizens were able to access fresh water by simply dropping buckets down into these \"wells.\" Several thousand cisterns provided the city with drinking water up until 1886, when an aqueduct was built (paralleling the railroad bridge) to bring in water from nearby mountains. Now the wells are capped, the clay tubs are rotted out, and rain drains from squares into the lagoon \u2014 or up from it, as the case may be.", "\r\n\tDuring these floods, some high-end hotels lend boots to their customers. Wooden benches are placed end-to-end in St. Mark's Square to create elevated sidewalks. It turns into total gridlock, as all the people normally sharing the whole square jostle for space on these narrow wooden walkways.", "\r\n\tSo what is Venice doing about the flooding? Since the 1966 flood, officials knew something had to be done, but it took about four decades to come up with a solution. In 2003, a consortium of engineering firms began construction on the MOSE Project. Named for the acronym of its Italian name, Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico, it's also a nod to Moses and his (albeit temporary) mastery over the sea.", "\r\n\tUnderwater \"mobile\" gates are being built on the floor of the sea at the entrances of the three inlets where the open sea enters Venice's lagoon. When the seawater rises above a certain level, air will be pumped into the gates, causing them to rise and shut out the Adriatic. The first gates are already installed, and the project is scheduled to finish by 2020. Will it work? Time\u2026and tides\u2026will tell.", "\r\n\tGene Openshaw is the co-author of the Rick Steves Venice guidebook.", "\r\n\tRiding a gondola is simple, expensive, and one of the great experiences in Europe.

Although the aristocracy preferred horses to boats through the early Middle Ages, beginning in the 14th century, when horses were outlawed from the streets of Venice, the noble class embraced gondolas as a respectable form of transportation.", "\r\n\tThe boats became the way to get around the lagoon's islands. To navigate over the countless shifting sandbars, the boats were flat (no keel or rudder) and the captains stood up to see. During the Age of Decadence, wannabe Casanovas would enjoy trysts in gondolas. Part of the gondolier's professional code was to never reveal what happened under the canopy of his little love boat.", "\r\n\tToday, there are about 400 gondolas in service, used only by tourists. The boats are prettier now, but they work the same way they always have. Single oars are used both to propel and to steer the boats, which are built curved a bit on one side so that an oar thrusting from that side sends the gondola in a straight line.", "\r\n\tThese sleek yet ornate boats typically are about 35 feet long and five feet wide, and weigh about 1,100 pounds. They travel about three miles an hour (same as walking) and take the same energy to row as it does to walk. They're always painted black (six coats) \u2014 the result of a 17th-century law a doge enacted to eliminate competition between nobles for the fanciest rig. But each has unique upholstery, trim, and detailing, such as the squiggly-shaped, carved-wood oarlock (f\u00f3rcula)  and metal \"hood ornament\" (ferro). The six horizontal lines and curved top of the ferro represent Venice's six sestieri (districts) and the doge's funny cap. All in all, it takes about two months to build a gondola.", "\r\n\tThe boats run about \u20ac35,000\u201350,000, depending on your options (a/c, cup holders, etc). Every 40 days, the boat's hull must be treated with a new coat of varnish to protect against a lagoon-dwelling creature that eats into wood. A gondola lasts about 15 years, after which it can be refinished (once) to last another 10 years.", "\r\n\tYou can see Venice's most picturesque gondola workshop (from the outside; it's not open to the public) in the Accademia neighborhood. The workmen, traditionally from Italy's mountainous Dolomite region (because they need to be good with wood), maintain this refreshingly alpine-feeling little corner of Venice.", "\r\n\tCarving the uniquely curvy oarlock is an art form.

Doing so is also a good way to see if you enjoy the gondolier's personality and language skills. Establish the price, route, and duration of the trip before boarding, enjoy your ride, and pay only when you're finished.", "\r\n\tWhile prices are pretty firm, you might find them softer during the day. Most gondoliers honor the official prices, but a few might try to scam you out of some extra euros, particularly by insisting on a tip. (While not required or even expected, if your gondolier does the full 40 minutes and entertains you en route, a 5\u201310 percent tip is appreciated; if he's surly or rushes through the trip, skip it.)

As Venice's commercial empire receded in the 1500s (when trade began to pick up along the Atlantic seaboard and dwindle in the Mediterranean), it redirected its economic agenda to terra firma \u2014 dominating the Veneto region. During the 16th century, Venice consolidated and incorporated Veneto into its economy. Rather than seagoing trade (Venice's forte), this area was busy with agribusiness \u2014 and that meant a need for lavish country villas. The region's many splendid villas were multifunctional. They served as business headquarters, a suitable place to host VIP guests, warehouse facilities, and the family home of the farmer. The standard Palladian villa had three floors: kitchen and cellar in the cool basement; fancy ground-level piano nobile \u2014 the \"noble floor\" \u2014 where aristocrats lived and hosted friends among marvelous frescoes; and an upstairs, with rooms for the extended family and for storing goods.

Walls between the rooms are wide enough to hide servants' corridors. Big, ornate stoves, which servants fed from behind, heated the rooms. The decor is splendid Baroque \u2014 the preferred style of divine monarchs, as it served as a kind of propaganda to sell the Old Regime notion that some were born to rule and others were born to be ruled.

The palace tells of her fairy-tale existence \u2014 her escapes, dieting mania, and chocolate bills. Sisi's hard-earned tiny waist was 21 inches around at age 50...after giving birth to four children. Her main goals in life seem to have been preserving her beautiful empress image, maintaining her Barbie Doll figure, and tending to her long, flowing hair. Peeking into her bathroom, you'll see the finest tub of its day resting on the first linoleum floor in Vienna...installed in 1888. Sisi has been compared to Princess Diana because of her beauty, bittersweet life, and tragic death \u2014 assassinated by an Italian anarchist in 1898. When you visit Vienna, it's easy to get caught up in the growing legend of Empress Elizabeth.", "\r\n\tThe Habsburgs ruled as Holy Roman Emperors, and they had some fancy jewels to prove it. In the Hofburg Palace's treasury, visitors reflect on the glitter of 20 rooms filled with precious paraphernalia, designed to help keep one royal family ruling a good part of Europe. A 500-year-old unicorn horn (or perhaps the tusk of a narwhal) was considered incredibly powerful in the Middle Ages.

How the royals wanted to be remembered is reflected in the tombs they often helped design. Franz Josef's is an appropriately austere military tomb. Sisi always seems to get the most flowers.", "\r\n\tWhile it's fun to chase down all these royal body parts, remember that the real legacy of the Habsburgs is the magnificence of their city. Stepping outside, I squint up and appreciate the brilliant, ornate skyline of Vienna.", "\r\n\tIf any European capital knows how to enjoy the good life, it's Vienna.

Apart from its apricot filling, the recipe seems pretty simple...chocolate on chocolate. You can sit inside the shop, with a view of the cake-making, or outside, with the street action. Fancy shops like this boast on their sign: \"K.u.K.\" (meaning good enough for the K\u00f6nig und Kaiser \u2014 king and emperor).", "\r\n\tFor another royally good experience, head to the wine gardens.

If you visit in fall, try Sturm, the semi-fermented new wine made from the season's first grape harvest and only available in autumn. Many locals claim that it takes several years of practice to distinguish between Sturm and vinegar. The red version is so hearty and fruity that locals say \"Eat up!\" when toasting with it.", "\r\n\tOf the many wine-garden suburbs, Grinzing is the most famous and lively.

Vienna soups come with fillings, such as semolina dumpling or pancake slices. Wiener schnitzel is a breaded and fried veal (or pork) cutlet.

The local hot-dog stand is a fixture on city squares throughout the old center, serving a variety of hot dogs and pickled side dishes with a warm corner-meeting-place atmosphere. Or eat at Buffet Trzesniewski, famous for finger sandwiches with toppings like chicken liver or herring.

Thousands of folding chairs face a 60-foot-wide screen up against the building's Neo-Gothic facade. The program differs every night, ranging from movies of opera to classical concerts. But even if you're not visiting in summer, you can get your fill of music by seeing the famous Vienna Boys' Choir, the city's world-renowned opera, or a hokey Mozart or Strauss concert performed by powdered-wigged musicians.", "\r\n\tIn this sleepy city, culture is king and locals are experts in the art of good living.

A split white monument, The Gates of Violence, remembers victims of all wars and violence. Standing directly in front of it, you're at the gates of a concentration camp.

The Habsburg emperors of the 17th and 18th centuries were not only generous supporters of music but fine musicians themselves. (Maria Theresa played a mean double bass.) Composers such as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, and Mahler gravitated to this music-friendly environment. They taught each other, jammed together, and spent a lot of time in Habsburg palaces. Beethoven was a famous figure, walking \u2014 lost in musical thought \u2014 through Vienna's wooded parks.", "\r\n\tAfter the defeat of Napoleon and the Congress of Vienna (in 1815, which shaped 19th-century Europe), Vienna enjoyed its violin-filled belle \u00e9poque, which shaped our romantic image of the city: fine wine, caf\u00e9s, waltzes, and these great chocolate cakes. The waltz was the rage, and \"Waltz King\" Johann Strauss and his brothers kept Vienna's 300 ballrooms spinning.", "\r\n\tThis musical tradition created the prestigious Viennese institutions that today's tourists enjoy: the opera, Boys' Choir, and great Baroque halls and churches, all busy with classical concerts.", "\r\n\tAs we split up the bill and drained the last of our coffee, the women took opera tickets out of their purses in anticipation. \"Where will you be sitting?\" Loni asked.", "\r\n\t\"Actually I'll be standing,\" I said. \"I'll get a Stehplatz, a standing-room-only ticket.\"", "\r\n\tThe women looked at me kindly, perhaps wondering if they should have paid my bill.", "\r\n\t\"A Stehplatz is just \u20ac3.50.

Architect Otto Wagner played a big part in shaping the urban landscape, helping to launch the 20th century in Vienna with a quietly revolutionary building: a bank for people who weren't rich. His Postal Savings Bank overlooks the street with a marble-sided facade that looks as secure as a safe-deposit box. It's bolted together with an exciting new material \u2014 aluminum \u2014 that claims this building for the modern age. Even now, as Wagner intended, form follows function: The building (open to the public) is still a savings bank.", "\r\n\tFine thematic exhibits seem to be popping up around Vienna. There's a worthwhile little museum dedicated to Wagner at the back of the Postal Savings Bank. The small and modern Jewish Museum documents the history of Vienna's Jewish community.

For the tourist, the Prater is its sugary-smelling, tired, and sprawling amusement park. For locals, the Prater is the vast, adjacent green park with its iconic tree-lined boulevard. The fun fair tempts all comers with its famous 220-foot-tall Ferris wheel, roller coasters, bumper cars, and endless eateries. Especially if you're traveling with kids, this is a fun, goofy place to share the evening with thousands of Viennese.", "\r\n\tVienna has a long history as Europe's music capital, and music lovers come to see the houses of the composers who lived and worked here. The homes of Schubert, Brahms, Haydn, Beethoven, and Mozart all host museums \u2014 but they are mostly small and forgettable.

The Vienna State Opera alone belts out 300 glittering shows a year. Fans of toe-tapping waltzes head to the Kursalon, an elegant hall in the main city park, where Johann Strauss himself directed concerts 100 years ago. Mozart lovers choose the intimate little Theater an der Wien, designed in 1801 especially for Wolfie\u2019s operas. This gilded high culture can be surprisingly affordable \u2014 a standing-room ticket for the opera is about the same price as a cinema ticket.", "\r\n\tFor a literal taste of old Vienna, step into one of the venerable caf\u00e9s clustered on St. Michael\u2019s Square, behind the hulking Hofburg (the Habsburg palace).

This was a bank for working-class people. The very concept of a postal savings bank makes storing your hard-earned income less intimidating for laborers than the palatial banks of the 19th century. The bank\u2019s design makes the service it provides feel almost sacred. Wagner believed, \u201cNecessity is the master of art.\u201d He declared, \u201cWhat is impractical can never be beautiful.\u201d Everything about the design \u2014 so gray, white, and efficient \u2014 is practical. While it\u2019s textbook \u201cform follows function,\u201d the form is beautiful nevertheless. A product of its age \u2014 so giddy with advancement \u2014 the building dignifies the technological and celebrates it as cultural.", "Architect Otto Wagner helped kick off the 20th century in Vienna with a radical building housing a radical new concept: a bank for people who weren\u2019t rich.", "Study the sleek, yet elegantly modern facade: Angles high above \u2014 made of an exciting new material, aluminum \u2014 seem to proclaim the modern age. The facade, with unadorned marble siding panels held on by aluminum-capped bolts, gives the impression that the entire building is a safety deposit box. The interior is similarly functionalist. The glass roof lets in light while the glass floor helps illuminate the basement. Fixtures, vents, and even the furniture fit right in \u2014 strong, geometrical, and modern. The main building is open to the public and still functions as a savings bank.

And the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum, a.k.a.

On two floors you\u2019ll see a rich collection of artifacts and historic treasures from Empress Maria Theresa to military genius Prince Eugene to Franz Josef. I found the 20th-century section particularly interesting. It includes an exhibit on Sarajevo in 1914 (with the car Archduke Franz Ferdinand was riding in \u2014 and the uniform he was wearing \u2014 when he was assassinated). For WWII buffs, there\u2019s a look at Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss (and the pre-Hitler Austrian fascist party), the Anschluss when the Third Reich absorbed Austria, and the devastation of World War II (\u20ac5, includes audioguide, daily 9:00-17:00, located inconveniently outside the Ringstrasse, a 10-minute walk behind the Belvedere Palace near the new Central Station at Arsenal Objekt 1, www.hgm.or.at).", "In 1914 the Habsburg Archduke Franz Ferdinand took a trip to Sarajevo in Bosnia to assert his family\u2019s reign on that hard-to-rule corner of Europe.

For the best music history experience, I like the Haus der Musik (www.hausdermusik.at) which honors the great Viennese composers with lots of actual historic artifacts on one fine floor. Vienna is still a thriving capital of classical music, with three local opera companies (including the world-famous Vienna State Opera putting on 300 performances a year). Its glorious music venues offer a total of 10,000 seats which are generally sold-out every night.

Wagner\u2019s Postal Savings Bank (built 1904-1907) overlooks the Ringstrasse (a.k.a. the Ring) with a facade that looks as secure as a safety deposit box. Its slinky angels atop the roof proclaim a new age made with a new metal \u2014 aluminum.

It offered workers an unintimidating way to save their earnings in a combination post office/bank, rather than in some palace for elites. Its form follows function everywhere, as \u201cnecessity is the master of art.\u201d With white and gray efficiency, the aluminum fixtures are simple yet elegant. A glass roof lets in light, and the glass floor allows light into the basement. The strong, geometric elements dignify the technological \u2014 and celebrate it as cultural. Wagner \u2014 like his angels on the roof \u2014 was heralding a new age. Facing this masterpiece across the street is the Kriegsministerium (the former ministry of war building).

A century later, his legacy is being reconsidered. While he did much to modernize Vienna, he\u2019s now seen as an anti-Semite \u2014 a demagogue who was admired by a young student in Vienna named Adolf Hitler.

The museum hosts an array of beautifully preserved historic trains fanning out from a grand roundhouse. A steam engine is sliced open, showing cylinders, driving wheels, and a smoke box in action. Exhibits trace the evolution of steam-powered transportation from very early trains like an 1830 stagecoach on rails to the aerodynamic Mallard \u2014 famous as the first train to travel at two miles per minute, a marvel back in 1938.", "\r\n\tThe focal point of York's half-timbered town center is the medieval butchers' street called the Shambles, with its rusty old hooks hiding under the eaves (the street's name is derived from \"shammell\" \u2014 a butcher's cutting block). Six hundred years ago, bloody hunks of meat hung here, dripping into the gutter that still marks the middle of the lane. This slaughterhouse of commercial activity gave our language a new word. What was once a \"shambles\" is now a busy Tudor lane of tourist shops.", "\r\n\tTo get away from the bustle, linger at one of York's fine upscale bistros or elegant teahouses.

I landed at noon at Heathrow, took the express train into London\u2019s Paddington Station, caught the tube to King\u2019s Cross, and hopped onto an express train. Two hours later, I was in the capital of north England: York. By 4 p.m. I was checked into my bed-and-breakfast and heading into the town. It\u2019s a city with a rich history and many dimensions for the visitor. Along with the standard sights, there are ghosts to hunt, riverside walks to enjoy, and fine food to taste.", "While ghost walks are little more than goofy entertainment, if any city can claim to be legitimately haunted, it would be York. Consequently, the old-town center is crawling with creepy, black-clad characters leading wide-eyed groups of tourists around on various ghost walks (90 minutes, \u00a35, leaving every night rain or shine, just show up). I spent an evening hopping off and on four different walks to assess them for my guidebook\u2026and woke up screaming at 2 a.m.", "Ever since English cyclists started winning the Tour de France and gold medals in the Olympics, biking has been trendy in England.
